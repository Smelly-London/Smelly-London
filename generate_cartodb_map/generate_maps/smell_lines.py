individuals, of being annoyed and injured by an excessively offensive stench, proceeding from premises connected with, and belonging to, the Tower Hamlets' Cemetery, I visited the spot on the 22nd instant", ' After using the pumps some time, the fluid thrown up by them, instead of being tolerably clear, became slate-coloured, muddy, of a very offensive smell, and much larger in quantity', " I

produced the effluvium 22 complained of, must continue till the drain is sufficiently emptied by the process to admit of repair", ' The abatement of the offensive effluvium did not meet our

quantity', ' The fluid pumped up in the Cemetery did not contain the salts which result from the decomposition of the human body in the earth, nor was the effluvium at all such as would be occasioned by any such cause', ' A careful investigation was instituted, not on the spot merely, but throughout the whole course of the sewer from which emanated so frequently the peculiar and offensive odour: samples were taken, at intervals, of the fluid contained in the sewer, and subjected to chemical test, particularly for sulphuretted hydrogen', ' There can be no doubt but that these are the most evident as well as the most productive causes of disease ; and while visible nuisances, and those recognised by smell, have received much attention from all who are engaged in the laudable work of improving the public health, it is not a little surprising that so fruitful a source of impurity as is found in the imperfect ventilation of small dwellings, should be either deemed unimportant, or

was generally attributed to the proper drainage of the soil of the Cemetery itself, which was supposed to have become impregnated with offensive matter, from the immense number of bodies which had been there interred', " This, however, on careful examination, proved to be erroneous, and the source of the stench was traced to the pollution of the soil by the refuse from the Great Central Gas Company's Works, which found its way through the contiguous soil, in so unobstructed a manner, that its offensive character remained unaltered", " The directors of the Tower Hamlets' Cemetery, upon

themselves", ' There is probably less effluvium proceeding from a cow than from any other animal of equal bulk and producing an equal quantity of manure and refuse litter', ' Sheep and horses, both of them herbivorous, have each a peculiar odour, that belonging to the former is especially unpleasant', ' If it were not that the remark is so frequently made to me, that the smell of a cow-house and of cows is healthy, and even a good remedy for some complaints, especially consumption, I should not think it worth while to notice it; and I only now avail myself of this opportunity to state that such

source of the nuisance; but stinking as this is often found to be, as a result of improper use, it is a local annoyance, and does not account for the complaints', ' Indeed, I felt confident that all of the above-recited causes combined, were inadequate to produce the stinks complained of', ' In two or three instances, at premises where no slaughtering had been done for some time, offensive smell was traced to collections of fatscraps, &c', ' The bags themselves necessarily become stinking, and it would be well if such fat were stored in impermeable and covered metal vessels pending removal', ' It was hoped that this plan would ensure the arrival of the sewage at the outfalls in a deodorized condition, and thus assist in the production of a satisfactory effluent; the object of the Board being to avoid the necessity for costly land filtration of the effluent, as recommended 230 by the Royal Commission on Metropolitan Sewage Discharge, with a view to ensure the removal of all odour and the possibility of "secondary fermentation', ' In summing up my observations on this system, I stated that it was averred, that " by the electrical process, the sewage is clarified; the bulk of the

to be due to sewer gas', ' One of these actions was based on complaint of nuisance from noxious smells arising at a brickfield at Streatham, interfering with the plaintiffs in the enjoyment of their

vested in the London County Council, with which body the late Yestry and the Council have had many communications arising out of complaints of smells, and also of the flooding of basements of houses at times of great and rapid rainfall', ' With respect to the smells, a memorial was addressed to the Council by numerous parishioners residing at South-row and adjoiniug streets in the Kensal Town district, taken over, in November, 1900, from Chelsea', ' To what extent, if at all, the constriction accounts for the effluvium nuisance I am unable to say', ' 94 Bad smells are frequently complained

explanation than the want of proper ventilation of the main sewer', '\xe2\x80\x94Pursuant to a reference by the Public Health Committee, consequent on complaints of offensive smells from a sewer ventilator in Peel-street, Campden-hill, and as to the desirability of some improved method being adopted for the ventilation of the sewer in that street, the Works Committee recommended the erection of a ventilating lamp column on the west side of Campden-hill-road, opposite the west end of Peel-street', ' The column was erected ; but further complaints having been made of smells from the same

works, such smells being caused by the elimination of sulphur impurities from the gas, according to the stringent requirements of the metropolitan gas referees, every known appliance for the prevention of nuisance was adopted', ' The Vestry adhered to the position taken up with regard to the legal responsibility of the Company to see that no nuisance should arise from smells from their

the ninth report for 1897 (September 16th, page 108), wherein I recommended\xe2\x80\x94 " 1', ' The subject was subsequently considered by the Sanitary Committee; the Surveyor, in a report (dated

ventilators, efforts are being made to obtain consent for the fixing of shafts up adjacent houses, and where such consent is obtained, the objectionable ventilators are abolished; whilst in those cases where consent is refused, the Vestry have no alternative but to retain the surface gratings', ' The only recommendation, perhaps, containing much of novelty is the second, which endorses a principle in the ventilation of sewers set out by your Vestry\'s Surveyor in his abovementioned report "On Sewer Ventilation and Sewer Smells " to the effect" That in conjunction with any interceptor hereafter 111 fixed on a main house drain, it shall be compulsory on the owner of the premises to carry up a ventilating pipe, not less than 24 square inches in sectional area, from the sewer side of the interceptor, up the front, side, or back of the house, to the satisfaction of the local Sanitary Authority', '" Here it may be mentioned that attempts to provide a chemical remedy for the nuisance of offensive smells in streets, due to the escape of foul emanations from surface sewer ventilating gratings\xe2\x80\x94viz', ' But the Sanitary Committee recommended, and it was resolved\xe2\x80\x94

the said sewer', ' The public (it was added)" occasionally, had taken the matter into their own hands and stopped up the offending apertures," a course which was described as one to be regretted, for the reason that "it is better to have a stench here and there in the roadway, than the escape of sewer gas into houses"; for, as pointed out, "sewers must be ventilated, and if ventilation is not provided for artificially, the resistance of almost any drain-trap will be overcome by the pressure of 116 the contained gases; and foul effluvia, with all their injurious consequences, will find their way into houses', '" The subject was again dealt with in the annual report for 1872 (page 23), and a suggestion having been thrown out that "all the gullies should be effectually trapped"\xe2\x80\x94a course which," as they are situated so much nearer houses than the ventilating shafts, would be satisfactory" to many persons annoyed by the stenches\xe2\x80\x94it was stated that this would not be prudent in respect of the older thoroughfares, wherein the ventilators are few in number and widely separated', '" The subject was once and again referred to, in the reports for

main line sewers belonging to the (late) Metropolitan Board of Works; with reference to which I 117 placed myself in communication with the engineer to the Board, who took steps in one instance to secure the removal of the cause for complaint', ' In former reports I had to note the frequency of complaints of effluvium nuisance arising in the storage, and, much more, in the removal of stable refuse from pits underground', ' But after a short detention in the usual brick receptacle it acquires a stink of its own, scarcely at all suggestive of the smell proper to peat, or to horse excreta',

system was being carried out, or, in the case of a suggested improvement, the directors of the Company would immediately give instructions for its adoption", " To the Company's letter a reply was sent, in November, intimating that the Vestry adhered to the position taken up with regard to the legal responsibility of the Company to see that no nuisance shall arise from smells from their works, and left it to the Company to appeal to the Gas Referees, if they thought any useful purpose would be served by their so doing", ' That the cause of nuisance is more or less within control would

openings in the roadways', ' Referring to one specially offensive opening, the engineer stated that "the gully is trapped with one of Doulton\'s best made flaps": he therefore "failed to see how any bad odours could possibly escape from the main sewer', '" But the stinks do occur, the reason being that the so-called trap\xe2\x80\x94a hanging flap at the outlet\xe2\x80\x94is not a trap in the proper sense of the word, and does not prevent the escape of sewer gas', ' Many complaints of offensive smells were received from inhabitants of the western section of Royal-crescent, Nottinghill', '

which is of great size (5ft', ' Towards the end of 1898, the sanitary committee, in connection with their inquiry into the causation of offensive smells in streets, resolved" to collect such information as might be available as to the systems adopted in provincial towns for the ventilation of sewers, and the prevention of nuisance from sewer gas', '\xe2\x80\x94With respect to street

most ancient type termed the Westminster Hopper" (as at Royal-crescent, Notting-hill); a larger number being stoneware pan gullies syphon-trapped; but the great majority consisting of brick catchpits,

these gullies: complaints of stench are few, and when a pan gulley has been substituted for the brick catch-pit, it has proved effectual', " More particularly was this the case in 1897, in connection with complaints of offensive smells from the County Council's main sewers, when the committee desired the law and parliamentary committee to advise them as to the position of the Vestry in regard to the matter generally", ' The law committee referred the matter to a sub-committee who reported thereon as follows:\xe2\x80\x94 "Your sub-committee have had before them the correspondence between the Vestry and the London County Council on this subject, and the report of the Medical Officer of Health on \'offensive smells in streets', ' "Power is given to the Vestry (but only with the consent of and after notice to the Council) to prevent effluvia from exhaling from main sewers; and in respect of these London County Council\'s sewers, we advise that the London County Council are liable for nuisance occasioned by smells, and not the Vestry', ' The committee stated, with reference to the proposed abolition of sewer ventilators at the road level, that\xe2\x80\x94 "In cases where complaints are made of nuisance, or annoyance is caused by offensive smells from sewer ventilators, efforts are being made to obtain consent for the fixing of shafts up adjacent houses, and where such consent is obtained, the objectionable ventilators are abolished; whilst in those cases where consent is refused, the Vestry have no alternative but to retain the surface gratings', ' I therefore consider it very hard that owing, as far as I can see, to some defect in the sewerage, I should be subjected to a continual stench arising from the impure water which enters my house at every storm\xe2\x80\x94 to say nothing of the damage to my carpets and furniture, and other discomforts and troubles arising therefrom', ' The nuisance (it was said) is due to stench, and is co-extensive with the trades which give rise to the production of refuse of an offensive nature', ' In any case the refuse should be collected daily, and conveyed in properly constructed covered receptacles, or in vehicles expressly adapted for the prevention of effluvium nuisance', ' In former reports I had to note the frequency of complaints of effluvium nuisance arising in the storage, and especially in the removal of stable refuse from pits underground', ' But after a short detention in the usual brick receptacle it acquires a stink of its own, scarcely at all suggestive of the smell proper to peat, or to horse excreta', ' But after a short detention in the usual brick receptacle it acquires a stink of its own, scarcely at all suggestive of the smell proper to peat, or to horse excreta', ' This stink is especially manifested when the refuse is disturbed in process of removal from the receptacle to the wagon\xe2\x80\x94the bottom layer in the receptacle forming the top layer of the load', " A reply was received to the effect that, while objectionable smells did proceed at times from the company's works at Kensal-green\xe2\x80\x94such smells being caused by the elimination of sulphur impurities from the gas, according to the stringent requirements of the metropolitan gas referees\xe2\x80\x94every known appliance for the prevention of nuisance was adopted by them", " To the company's letter a rejoinder was sent intimating that your Vestry adhered to the position taken up with regard to the legal responsibility of the company to see that no nuisance shall arise from smells from their works, and leaving it to the company to appeal to the gas referees, if they thought any useful purpose would be served by their so doing", ' That the cause of nuisance is more or less within control would appear from the intermittency of the complaints, and as the smells are at times not perceptible to any noxious degree in the vicinity of the works']}, 'Barnet': {'1962': [' The deodorising plant at the Sewage

from each of these places, used as sleeping apartments, was most offensive', ' This complaint was followed by a memorial to the Board, signed by 56 inhabitants of the immediate vicinity, setting forth

proportion of oxygen, but it contains three times the usual amount of carbonic acid, besides a quantity of aqueous vapour, charged with alkaline matter, which stinks abominably', ' The smell arising from each of these rooms was most offensive', ' Because slaughter-houses as now conducted are nuisances, and injurious to health, and although, theoretically, they may be kept "as clean as any paved wash-house," it would be found impracticable to do so ; and it would be impossible to enact a law which should compel the owner of a slaughter-house to prevent offensive smells from issuing from his premises'], '1873': [' There was a most offensive smell in the schools, arising from the basement, which, upon examination, was found to proceed from a cesspool in the yard, which received the filth from the closets and drains of two adjoining houses', ' The discomfort above mentioned is not all that a poor family occupying a single room has to endure ; for when occupying the upper room of a house three storeys high, the labour of carrying water up stairs, and conveying the same after it has been used down again, is so great that the linen is never properly washed, owing to the small quantity of water which is used in the washing of it, and when dried has an offensive smell', ' These are found to be great nuisances, for it is impossible to keep them clean, and the smell from them is frequently perceptible in the houses contiguous to them', ' Several complaints having from time to time been made of the offensive smell from these premises, I visited them late one evening, and ascertained that the nuisance arose from the escape of offensive steam 9 from a pipe which passed from the vessel in which the materials for making the glucose are boiled, through the roof of the building', ' There was no doubt whatever that the smell of this steam was very offensive, and I suggested that, instead of carrying the pipe through the roof of the building, it should be conveyed into or sufficiently near the furnace so as to destroy all the offensive products', ' The smell of this room was very offensive, although the window was open', ' The eight houses on the west side of the court are very old\xe2\x80\x94the walls and flooring of the cellars are wet, and a most unwholesome smell comes through the floors of the lower rooms, which renders such rooms unfit for

the trade of a Marine Store Dealer, carried on in the rear of 28, Great Pearl Street, Spitalfields', ' The inhabitants complained that they were unable to open their windows in consequence of the offensive smell from the premises in question, arising from a large accumulation of filthy rags and other offensive matter'], '1870': [' The importance of the daily emptying of the public dust bins cannot be over estimated, and it should be rigidly enforced; for the smell of the contents of these receptacles, when they arc allowed to remain unemptied for a period longer than 24 or 30 hours, is sometimes intolerable, and is a cause of ill health to persons living in the vicinity of them', ' The Rector of Whitechapel Parish has made frequent complaints to this Board of the nuisance arising from the smell of urine, caused by hundreds of persons rushing over to this street from the theatre immediately opposite', ' The words used are "that from these places, formerly the dens of fever, typhus has been entirely banished !" Now, if overcrowding, defective ventilation, the most abominable smells, arising from the smoking of tobacco, and from the dirty clothes and unwashed bodies of the lodgers, who meet together in large numbers in the kitchens, and by the use of water stored in butts, without covers or taps, and exposed to the contaminating influence of the atmosphere of a crowded neighbourhood, will produce fever; then, it follows, that, where these evils exist, as they unquestionably do, in many of these lodging houses, fever * Although at the present time it would be almost hopeless to insist upon a larger space for a bed than 315 cubic feet, yet, in the course of a few years when sanitary science is better understood, a larger space will be demanded, probably, at least, 400 cubic feet;

Scientific men, however, who have investigated this subject, have arrived at a different conclusion respecting the alleged wholesomeness of the atmosphere of cow-houses, and they have adduced numerous instances showing that they are injurious to health', ' During the prevalence of the hot weather, it would be very conducive to the health of the inhabitants, if the scavengers were to cleanse the narrow and densely populated localities every day; for no person, unless he has experienced it, can form an idea of the horrible stench that arises in them, where a large quantity of decaying animal and vegetable refuse is being swept up by the scavengers', '-A letter was sent by the Medical Officer of Health to the owner of this Court, recommending him to erect a public Dust bin instead of that in the basement of each house, as the smell from it is very offensive, and produces illness, particularly in those tenants in the upper rooms', ' In conclusion, permit me to mention, in a few words, what in my opinion, are the most prolific sources of disease,\xe2\x80\x94the want of cleanliness of the person and of the clothing,\xe2\x80\x94the want of cleanliness, and of efficient ventilation in inhabited rooms, especially in sleeping-rooms, \xe2\x80\x94the non-removal of all offensive odours, particularly the offensive odour from over-crowding, \xe2\x80\x94the cesspool odour, from want of drainage,\xe2\x80\x94the cesslake or sewer emanations from the defective construction of the sewers,\xe2\x80\x94the deficiency of light, especially of solar light, caused by the closely-packed houses in narrow courts,\xe2\x80\x94the want of an ample supply of pure water,\xe2\x80\x94 and the deficiency of food and clothing, It is, therefore, to these points that both public and individual attention must be directed, in order to improve the moral and physical condition of the people, and to diminish the burdens of the rate-payers, in providing for the sick and infirm'], '1887': [' It is therefore imperative to differentiate between Deodorants, which merely mask mal-odours, and Disinfectants, which are absolute germicides'], '1856': ['" If the remark above cited be true, and if there exist in the air an unpleasant odour, or any thing which produces a painful sensation, I do not think it can be disputed, it certainly behoves every one who carries on a trade which is a nuisance or an annoyance to the neighbourhood, to adopt every means which experience has pointed out, to mitigate, if not entirely prevent, its deleterious influence', ' Neil, that "It is not necessary that a public nuisance should be injurious to health; if there be smells offensive to the senses, that is enough, as the neighbourhood had a right to fresh and pure air', ' White, held that " It was not necessary that a smell should be unwholesome; it is enough, if it renders the enjoyment of life and property uncomfortable', " The smell arising from the manure, urine, brewers' grains, and distillers' wash, is very offensive and injurious to the public health"], '1857': [], '1892': [' Freely use water and carbolic "acid to cleanse drains and sinks, No food which looks bad or which has an "unpleasant smell, should be eaten', ' Report to the Officers of the Board when any unpleasant smells or "nuisances of any kind are noticed'], '1893': [], '1886': [], '1861': [' During the last three months I have visited several public schools in the district, and I found them, generally speaking, to be over-crowded For instance, in one of the schoolrooms, a cubic space of seventy-two feet was allotted to each scholar ; in another, the cubic space was sixty-five feet, in another, eighty-five feet, whilst in another, the cubic space for each child was only forty-six feet The ventilation in all these over-crowded schools was very defective, and in more than one instance, the smell of the room was most offensive In an atmosphere rendered impure by the exhalations from the lungs and skin of many persons congregated in a confined space, the nervous system becomes so depressed, that, from the inability of fixing the attention, scholars cannot learn, and teachers cannot teach; and if the breathing of such an impure atmosphere be long continued, the health of both scholars and teachers will become impaired The evils resulting from an over-crowded and ill-ventilated school room might be much diminished, by keeping the children for a shorter time in school, or by adopting what is called "the half-time system," which will reduce the evil to at least one-half, and during the interval of school instruction, permitting the children to engage in out door amusement; and during the absence of the children, opening all the windows and doors It is to me a matter of regret that a model school, on sanitary principles, has not been, as yet, recommended by the educational department of the Privy Council The recommendations, hitherto put forth by that body for the construction of a school, are faulty in the extreme In the minutes of the Council of Education, 1B51-52, relating to the organization of schools, it is recommended that, "in planning a school-room, if it be not more than eighteen feet in width, then about eight or nine square feet will be sufficient for each child in actual attendance; if the width be greater, there must be a proportionate increase of area allotted to each child" Here, the height of the ceiling is not mentioned, the omission of which, renders the recommendation of but little practical utility Again, if the school-room be lighted from above, which the Committee say "is the best possible mode, care should be taken to prevent the skylight from leaking,\' &c "It is very important," say this Committee, "that the dimensions of a school-room should be graduated to suit the sizes of the elder and younger children" The recommendation of regulating the area of a school to the size of a child, is at variance with the laws of physiology, which demand the same space for a child as for an adult, in consequence of the greater rapidity of its respiration A child is more susceptible to the bad effects of an impure air than is an adult; and more air is required for the proper nourishment of its body during its growth, than is required for it in after life It is of the utmost importance that the school-room should be of a genial temperature, but this cannot be sustained if there be a glass roof, even if care be taken " to prevent it from leaking," because, during the winter the warm air of the room rapidly escapes through the glass roof, and during the summer, the heat of the sun passing through and reflected from the glass, makes the room so hot that it is almost insupportable The usual plan of building an infant gallery is also bad as regards the health of those children who occupy the upper form; for they inhale the air which has been vitiated by those on the lower forms, and the nearer the upper form is to the ceiling, the worse is the arrangement', " The undermentioned trades-nuisances have been complained of\xe2\x80\x94a soap manufactory, a wadding manufactory, a lucifer manufactory, a skin dressing manufactoiy, &c All these premises have been visited by me, and in every case, the proprietor has made such alterations in the mode of conducting the business as to abate the nuisance The offensive smell arising from the exposure for sale of cats' meat has been lessened by requiring the vendors to keep the bulk of such offensive substance in covered barrels, and to expose for sale a small quantity only at a time", ' Complaints against persons having large quantities of manure on their premises are very numerous If the manure be allowed to remain more than two days, the smell arising from it is very offensive; and if the manure has been allowed to accumulate for several days, then the smell from it, while in the course of removal, is almost intolerable I have personally visited all the premises in the district which have formed the subject of this complaint, and I have, in each instance, given directions to the proprietors to remove the dung every other day', ' BOARD OF WORKS, WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT ON The Sanitary Contrition OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 28th DECEMBER, 1861 By JOHN LIDDLE, Medical Officer of Health Read to the Board, February 10th, 1862 LONDON; PRINTED BY MEAD & POWELL, 101, WHITECHAPEL, E, AND 73, CHEAPSIDE, EC 1862, SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT For the Year ending 28th December, 1861 Gentlemen, The sixth year of my office as your Medical Officer of Health having recently terminated, I have again the honor of laying before you my Annual Report of the sickness and mortality in your district The returns of the local registrars show that in the course of the fifty-two weeks comprised in the year 1861, the registered births have been 2,686, of which 1,373 are males, and 1,313 are females The deaths during the same period have been 2,331, viz: 1,217 males and 1,114 females, including those of 179 non-residents This is at the rate of 27-2 per 1,000, or one in 37 of the entire population; but if all the deaths (366) which occurred in the London Hospital be excluded from the calculation, then the rate of mortality in the district is 25-2 per 1,000, or 1 in 40 of the entire population In the previous year 2,746 births, and 2,302 deaths were registered; the number of births therefore in this year is less by 60, and that of deaths greater by 29 The deaths from epidemic diseases are 388, which number is an increase of 42 upon that of the previous year Small-pox shows an increase of 7 deaths, scarlet fever and diphtheria of 11, hooping cough of 49, and diarrhcea of 54; whilst the deaths from measles arc less by 54, and those from fever by 5 The deaths from epidemic diseases during this year are in the proportion of 16-2 per cent of the total mortality, whilst in the preceding year the deaths from these diseases were in the proportion of 15 per cent On referring to table No XIII in the appendix, the number of deaths from epidemic diseases in each year since 1856 will be seen; from which table it appears that the deaths from this class of diseases have greatly diminished, viz: from 421 to 346 The greatest mortality from epidemic diseases occurred in 1858, when 498 deaths were registered If the number of deaths under the head of typhus be referred to, it will be seen that from 1856 to the present period, it has been annually less Thus, in 1856 the deaths from fever were 188; in 1857, they were 117; in 1858, 104; in 1859, 93; in 1860, 69; and in 1861 they were 64 This table is further interesting, as showing the increase and diminution of the several epidemic diseases This term includes typhus, typhoid, eutcric, gastric, pythogenic, and low fever The word typhus is derived from a Greek word, signifying stupor, which is only one of the symptoms of the disease Typhoid means "like typhuspythogenic is the term applied by Dr Murchison to typhoid fever, and is derived from two Greek words signifying generated from putrescence 3 Thus, during the year 1856 the deaths from measles were only 12; in 1860 they were 81; and in 1857, the deaths from small-pox were only 3, while in 1859 they were 60 I cannot offer any explanation of the increase of one class of epidemic diseases, and the diminution of another; but, whatever may be the primary cause of any of these diseases, there can be no doubt that, for the most part their effects are intensified by filth, overcrowding, and defective ventilation The bad effects of overcrowding, and of the nonobservanee of other hygienic rules are seen in the large mortality of all the registration districts; but, from the circumstance of so many of the poor, when they are ill, being conveyed either to the workhouse or to the hospital, it is extremely difficult to ascertain in which registration district the greatest relative mortality prevails Of the 2,331 deaths, there were 1,074, or 46-0 per cent of persons under five years of age, and of these, 501, or 21-4 per cent were of infants under the age of twelve months The mortality under five years of age during the preceding year was 1045, or 45-3 per cent of the total deaths It is chiefly amongst the poor that the greatest infantile mortality prevails The laws of health, as regards the bringing up of children, are not alike observed by the rich and the poor During the year, 145 persons died of old age, of whom, 72 were above 80, and of these, one had arrived at the advanced age of 99; and another, at the still more advanced age of 102 It must not, however, be inferred from a few instances of longevity, that a district is healthy, but it is to the smallness of the mortality among young children that the healthiness of any particular district must be inferred; for children of tender years are more susceptible to the influences of impure air than are adults It would also be found, if records had been kept of the number of still-born children, and of premature births, that in those districts where sanitary regulations were the least observed, there would be the greatest proportionate number of such cases There are 63 deaths uncertified by a medical practitioner The number of inquests that have been held during the year is 237 This is an increase of 17 upon the number held during the preceding year The deaths in the workhouse are 287, or 12-3 per cent of the total deaths; those in the London Hospital are 366, or 15-7 per cent of the total mortality in the district The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs are 460, or 19 per cent The tubercular class of diseases, including consumption, which alone numbers 248 deaths, exhibits a mortality of 391, or 16-7 per cent Violence and accidents of various kinds proved fatal to 214, or 9-1 percent; of these,42 were the result of burns and scalds The cases of illness attended by the medical officers of the union, exclusive of those in the workhouse, were 13,724 Of these, 3,489 occurred during the quarter recently terminated In the workhouse the number of cases of sickness was 2,191; and of these, 527 occurred during the last quarter; the total number of cases therefore that have come under the care of the medical officers of the union during the year was 15,915 During the preceding year the total cases of sickness attended by the medical officers of the union were 13,069, viz: 11,392 among the out-door poor, and 1,677 in the workhouse The births during the last quarter of the year 1861, have been 665, viz: 329 males and 336 females This is in the proportion of 102 females to 100 males The number of females to males being greater is very unusual, for the normal proportion of births of males and females is as 106 of the former, to 100 of the latter The total number of deaths registered in this district during the same period was 556, of which 321 were deaths of males, and 265 those of females, including the deaths of 42 non-residents In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the registered births were 696, and the deaths 530 The number of births therefore is less by 31, and the number of deaths greater by 26 The deaths from epidemic diseases are 100; of these, 34 are recorded as having been caused by scarlet fever, and 27 by fever; while in the corresponding quarter of the previous year the total number of deaths from epidemic diseases was 81, of which number, 24 were caused by scarlet fever, and 11 by fever The deaths from small-pox have likewise increased (8 against 5) Dr Munk, the Physician to the Small-pox Hospital has kindly forwarded to me a return of the cases admitted into that institution during the last three months; from which it appears that, out of the 49 cases admitted, 13, or rather more than a fourth of the total number were from this district; and recently, three more cases from this district have been sent to the Small-Pox Hospital Notwithstanding all the efforts of the legislature, and the zeal of 4 medical practitioners to promote vaccination among all classes, it is apparent from the notes of the local registrars of deaths, and from the remarks of the medical officers of the union, that vaccination is not universally practised During the quarter, six cases of suicide occurred; two persons put a period to their existence by hanging; two died from self-inflicted wounds of the throat, two destroyed themselves by taking poison, one of them by laudanum, and the other by corrosive sublimate A man killed himself by drinking raw spirits in excess A case of manslaughter is recorded Among the records of death is that of a child having died from the effects of a scald of the glottis from drinking boiling water from a tea kettle A case of death in the London Hospital is thus recorded by a Coroner\'s jury:\xe2\x80\x94"Diphtheria, caused by severe burns" A man, aged 45, died from inflammation of the lungs, caused by severe injury from the falling of a log of wood on his fingers A death is recorded to have occurred from exhaustion, caused by destitution Erysipelas, occurring after vaccination, is said to have caused the death of a child six months old The number of inquests held during the quarter is 56, of which, 28 were held on persons dying in the London Hospital Several cases of sudden death, occasioned by natural causes, have very properly been made the subject of medico-legal inquiry; but the majority of the deaths on which inquests have been held was on those which were caused by violence The deaths in the workhouse during the quarter are 61, and in the London Hospital 89 In the former-named institution, four deaths from fever occurred; and in the latter, five; of which number two were of non-residents The cases of illness attended by the medical officers of the union were 3,489, exclusive of 527 cases in the workhouse Of these latter, Mr Champneys attended 234, and Mr Richardson 293 The cases of fever have been very numerous, both in and out of the workhouse, 42 having been treated in the workhouse, and 62 among the out-door poor, besides 267 cases of febricula or slight fever Some of these terminated in fever of a serious form: several of the cases of fever, however, which were at first seen as out-door cases, were subsequently admitted into the workhouse, and are therefore recorded twice It is with a feeling of deep regret that I have to announce the prevalence of fever in this district; although fewer deaths from this disease occurred in this district during the year 1861 than in any previous year; yet, in the last quarter they amounted to 27, which is 16 above that of the corresponding quarter of the previous year Fever is at present principally confined to the localities of the poor; a few instances, however, of persons in easy circumstances have died from its effects For the week ending January 25th, five deaths from fever occurred in the workhouse; and the cases, both in and out of the workhouse, still continue to be very numerous The disease is nevertheless of comparatively trifling extent, if we compare the present number of its victims with that in the year ending Lady-day, 1838; when out of a total of 5,312 pauper cases of sickness, 2,134, or nearly one-half, were cases of fever In this number there were included all cases of the disease, whether they were of a mild or severe nature Of these cases 214* died, 82 were sent to the Fever Hospital, and at the time of making up the return, 107 were under treatment It appears from the return furnished by the late Mr John Smith, that the extra expense incurred by the union for fever cases alone, was estimated to have been \xc2\xa3400 for one quarter of the year only Those members of the Board who can recollect what was the general sanitary condition of the district about 24 years ago, and more especially the condition of the houses of the poor as regards their filthy and overcrowded state, together with the dirty state of the courts and alleys, and the almost total absence of draina ge in these places, and will compare the sanitary state of the district at that time with that which now exists, cannot fail to notice that a vkst improvement has taken place Although, in order to effect this improvement, large sums of money have been expended, yet the result of the outlay has been most advantageous to the poor, as is evident not only from the diminished rate of mortality among them, but also from the less protracted period of sickness and convalescence of those who recover The benefit of these improvements has not been confined to the poorer classes, but is shared by the rate-payers, who are not now called upon to expend so much of the rates in supplying additional assistance to the sick poor, and in providing for the increased number of widows and orphans, which a severe epidemic of fever always occasions If the sanitary condition of the district had not been improved, it is highly probable that the present epidemic of fever would have been as severe as it was in 1838 * This number does not include all the deaths from fever which occurrcd in the Union, but those only which occurred amongst the pauper population 5 It is the generally received opinion that typhus fever\xe2\x80\x94the disease that in the time of the illustrious Howard was fatal to so many of the prisoners in jail\xe2\x80\x94is occasioned by the emanations of the body in crowded and ill ventilated rooms; and that typhoid, gastric, or pythogenic fever is caused by the emanations of offensive cesspools, and badly constructed drains These last-mentioned sources of disease are frequently not known to exist in houses tenanted by the upper and middle classes of society; bad smells, which are disregarded, frequently pervade the basements, and it is only when disease has attacked one or more members of the family, that upon a diligent investigation being made, an old cesspool is discovered, or the joints of the drain-pipes are found to be imperfectly cemented; or that, if the drains are constructed with bricks, they are discovered to have become dilapidated I have too much reason to believe that, in several instances, where orders have been given to landlords to destroy the cesspool, and to connect the drainage of the house with the main sewer; instead of filling up the cesspool with dry rubbish, a drainpipe has been inserted near the top of it, by which, the more fluid contents only of the cesspool pass away, and it is when bad smells frequently occur, that the cause is sought for, and the offending cesspool detected Although much has been accomplished to improve the drainage of the metropolis generally, and many new sewers have been constructed in this district, yet it must be admitted that much more is required to be done in a similar direction before the system of drainage will be complete Even if all the localities in the district were provided with sewers, yet it would be found that, so long as the present defective mode of constructing the public sewers is persisted in, it would be impossible to prevent their offensive and dangerous emanations from discharging themselves into the public streets and inhabited houses Until all decomposing animal matter is effectually removed from our cities and towns, an occasional outbreak of typhoid fever may be expected; but the more complete our system of drainage shall be made, the less extensive and severe will be the ravages of typhoid fever Dr Murchison says "That typhoid fever is less contagious than typhus, and it is quite independent of the causes which give rise to it; typhoid fever being generated by the putrid emanations from decaying organic (animal) matter Typhoid fever is always more prevalent in autumn, or after a long continuance of hot weather Typhoid fever is not, like typhus, limited to the poor, but is met with among the poor and rich alike Typhoid fever is not confined to overcrowded localities, but appears alike in the most dense, and in the least populous districts of large towns, and even in isolated houses in the country" Dr Budd, of Bristol, states that "The emanations from patients suffering from typhoid fever are infectious, and that the infectious power of the alvine discharges may be destroyed by placing two ounces of chloride of zinc in the night-stool on each occasion before it is used by the fever patient Typhoid fever rarely re-attacks a person who has once suffered from it" The temperature of the atmosphere during the quarter has been rather above the average Mr Glashier, the astronomer royal, in his remarks upon the weather, states that we must travel back to 1831 for an October so warm as the last, and then back to 1811 for a second example The mean temperature of last October was 5\xc2\xb0 in excess of its average In November the weather was cold On the 18th November, the thermometer was below 32\xc2\xb0; but from the 25th, until the 24th of the following month, the weather was warm, when a change again took place, and the \'w eather was cold until the end of the year The variable temperature of the quarter was severely felt by those persons whose delicate constitution could not resist the effects of the sudden rise and fall in the temperature of the air From the returns of the sanitary inspectors, it appears that during the past year 429 cesspools have been destroyed, and the houses which were drained into these receptacles are now drained into the main sewers In almost every instance the sanitary improvements have been carried into effect without obtaining the aid of the Board in instituting legal proceedings Improvements have been effected in the drainage and paving of Inkhorn Court, and Jones\' Buildings The houses in George Court, George Street, have been converted into a common lodging-house, and are now under the inspection of the police This court was one of the worst places in the district, and notices were from time to time served upon the owner to cleanse and repair the property, and it is now greatly improved 6 During the last six months, about 70 houses, inhabited principally by the poor, have been pulled down in Swallow\'s Gardens and its immediate vicinity, owing to the extension of the Blackwall Railway It is estimated that about 700 persons have been compelled to remove from this locality and seek lodgings elsewhere; not, it is to be hoped, in the already overcrowded courts in this district, otherwise, so far from the taking down of houses for the extension of traffic being beneficial to the health of the inhabitants of a district, the reverse will be the case The keeping of pigs is a continually recurring nuisance; notices in six instances have been served upon the owners to discontinue the practice Information was given at the office of the board that, in North Street, the dead body of a child had been kept, during a fortnight, in a room occupied by a family as a living and sleeping room; upon inquiry, the statement was ascertained to be correct, and a notice from the inspector was immediately served upon the father of the child to bury it forthwith, who, in the course of the following day, complied with the order, and had the child buried On referring to Table XII, it will be seen that 43 courts, inhabited by the poor, have been visited by the inspectors, and particulars obtained respecting the drainage, paving, water supply, general condition of the rooms, and how occupied, &c These courts contain 388 houses, in which are 1,076 rooms, and are occupied by 3,132 people From information obtained by the inspectors, it appears that in 68 instances the rooms were indecently occupied, that is to say, adult brothers and sisters, or a father and daughter, slept together in the same room The particulars of each case are recorded in the appendix We may well inquire how such gross indecency, and want of self-respect can exist in this country, which is usually considered to be the centre of civilization, and where so much money is annually expended in imparting religious and moral instruction to the people; yet, such is the state in which many of the inhabitants of this district live, as is ascertained on a house to house visitation It is a common and true remark "that one half of the world does not know how the other half lives" Before, therefore, the existing evils can be remedied, they must first be made known, and it is to be hoped, that in course of time, public opinion will be brought to bear upon the demoralised condition in which so many of our fellow citizens live, that a change for the better will then take place It is not among the " arabs," or vagrants of society only that this indifference to decency is found to exist, but it is also seen among the industrious labouring population, in whom we should expect to find a more general feeling of self-respect When I have pointed out to the respective parents the impropriety of living together in the promiscuous manner above described, I have been told by some it was poverty that prevented them taking two rooms for the family; and by others, that they did not consider it in any way improper for all the members of the same family to live and sleep in the same room As regards the first named plea, it is in every instance, except in cases of illness, inadmissible, for it is surely possible, for adults in health, to earn a sufficient sum weekly to pay for a lodging, notwithstanding the very high rents the poor people pay for their lodgings These high rents are the result of the system adopted by landlords in employing agents, who again employ sub-agents to collect the rents and manage the estate; and also by the expense landlords incur by the wilful destruction of their property by the tenants, and likewise by the loss of rent occasioned either by the dishonesty of the tenants, or by their inability to pay the rent As regards the second plea advanced, viz,\xe2\x80\x94ignorance of the impropriety of all the family occupying the same room by night, as well as by day ; this must be overcome by the lessons of the moralist, and by the instruction of the ministers of religion I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient

are kept', ' The nuisance arising from the marine store shops might be greatly mitigated if the several articles from which an offensive smell was likely to arise were kept in well-closed 7 casks, and removed, after a few days, from the premises, before decomposition took place', " A nuisance occasioned by the storing of a large quantity of German cheese (a cheese emitting a very offensive smell)

Board, of the offensive smells proceeding from premises used for the keeping of cows, I was directed to visit the premises complained of, with a view of suggesting such improvements as would lead to the mitigation of the evils; but, before making a report upon the subject,I deemed it expe- 8 dient to make a systematic and complete visitation of all cow-houses within the district, for the purpose of ascertaining, from personal inspection, the general condition of the animals and of the places where they are kept'], '1863': [' In Jones\' Buildings, a place in which the houses are without back

OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR the Year ending 31st December, 1864, BY JOHN LIDDLE, Medical Officer of Health presented to the board, 23RD january, 1865 London: PRINTED BY R BIRKETT, 27, NORTON FOLGATE 1865 NINTH ANNUAL REPORT, For the Year ending 31st December, 1864 Gentlemen, The total number of deaths registered in the Whitechapel District during the quarter ending on Saturday, the 31st December, including those in the London Hospital (110), were 654, of which 361 were of males and 293 of females The average number of deaths for this quarter during the preceding eight years is 610 The excess of deaths, therefore, is 44 above the average The mortality during this quarter has been at the annual rate of 33 in 1,000, or 1 in 30 of the population In the more healthy districts in England, the rate of mortality is only 15 in 1,000, or 1 in 66 of the population The births have been 656, of which 330 were of males and 326 of females The births have exceeded the deaths by 11 only; but if the deaths of the 52 nonresidents are excluded, then the excess of births over deaths is 63 The average number of deaths per week has been 503 Of the 110 deaths in the London Hospital, 56 were of persons who died from the result of accident and from sudden death (The residences of these are not given in the returns) Of the remaining 54, 2 were of persons residing in the district, and 52 of nonresidents The greatest weekly mortality (71) occurrcd in the week ending November 19th During this week, although the mean temperature was 28\xc2\xb0 above the average, the variations in the temperature of the air had been very considerable In October the mean temperature had been 51\xc2\xb0 In the first week in November it fell to 424\xc2\xb0; in the next week to 375\xc2\xb0; and in the following week it rose again to 455", when the total mortality in London was 1742, which is 331 above "the average number of deaths for the fortysixth week of ten years 185463,\xe2\x80\x94the average number of deaths being, with a correction for increase of population, 1,411" The deaths from epidemic diseases have been 93, from puerperal fever 3, from erysipelas 6 (of which 2 were of infants aged respectively 3 weeks and 14 days), from pysemia 1, from diseases of the respiratory organs 1 66, from diseases of the heart 20, from tubercular diseases 97 ("of which 65 were from consumption) Two persons, aged respectively 74 and 35, residents in Bethnal Green, died in the London Hospital from urasmic poisoning, and 1 (a cab proprietor), residing in Spitalfields, from acute farcy glanders The deaths arising from accidents or negligence were 51, of which 14 were caused by burns and scalds, 4 from suffocation (of which 1 was that of a man aged 61 who was suffocated from a piece of beef lodging in the windpipe), 1 from a gunshot wound, 1 from the bite of a dog, and 1 from drowning Two persons destroyed themselves by hanging, whilst under temporary derangement 4 Although the deaths from epidemic diseases (93) form a large proportion, viz 113 per cent, or oneseventh of the total deaths, yet this class of diseases has not been so fatal during this quarter as it was in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, when the deaths from epidemic diseases were 128 The deaths from fever have diminished from 52 to 31 This is certainly satisfactory ; but notwithstanding the regular and systematic visitation by the Inspectors of all the places in the district, fever has been found to occur and attack severely the inhabitants of certain localities Thus, at No 8, Court Street, there were 8 cases of fever within two months The Medical Officer of the Union states that the disease spread from one to another, and, notwithstanding his urgent entreaties, the persons first attacked refused to be removed Again, at No 82, Wentworth Street, 9 cases of fever occurred in the course of about 5 weeks Also, at 9, George Yard, there were 10 cases within a month All these places were duly visited, and orders served upon the landlords to lime white the several rooms At No 82, Wentworth Street, it was found that the basement (in which 2 cases of fever occurred) was not fit for human habitation An order to close this room was served upon the landlord, and it is now unoccupied The mortality under 5 years of age has been 251 This is 383 per cent, of the total deaths In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the mortality of children under 5 years was, in relation to the total deaths, 424 per cent In the Spitalfields SubDistrict, however, the mortality of children is 556 per cent During the preceding quarter it was 72l per cent The deaths of persons above 80 years of age have been 15, of which 1 had arrived at the advanced age of 95 There has been a large mortality, viz 224 (which is above onethird of the total deaths), among persons in the prime of life,\xe2\x80\x94that is, between the ages of 20 and 60 The number of inquests held on the bodies of those who died suddenly, or whose death was occasioned by violence, lias been 83 Of these sudden and violent deaths, 10 were occasioncd by the abuse of ardent spirits,\xe2\x80\x94a number larger than has in any previous quarter been recorded The deaths uncertified by a member of the medical profession are less in number than heretofore; they amount to 4 One of these deaths is recorded in the following terms:\xe2\x80\x94" Atalectasis, female, ten hours" The deaths in the Workhouse have been 91, including 11 from fever, 1 from smallpox, 1 from measles, and 2 from diarrhoea The Medical Officers of the Union have attended 3,911 new cases of illness, including 6 of smallpox, 90 of measles, 56 of scarlet fever, 58 of hooping cough, 119 of diarrhoea, and 89 of fever In addition to these, 3 or 4 cases of leadpoisoning are recorded In the corresponding quarter of last year, the total number of cases was 3,803, including 161 of fever and 13 of smallpox The cases of illness in the Workhouse have been 804 Of these Mr Champneys attended 426, and Mr Richardson 378 Included in the total 5 number are 1 of smallpox, 4 of measles, 17 of diarrhoea, 127 of fever, 3 of rheumatic fever, 1 of carbuncle, 4 of erysipelas, and 3 of delirium tremens In the corresponding quarter of last year the total number of cases was 656, including 90 of fever The waterwaste preventers which have been in use in the district during the last nine months appears to work very satisfactorily Since my last report two additional ones have been erected, one in the district supplied by the New River Company, the other in that of the East London There are now seven of these machines in operation, and no complaint has as yet been made to me respecting them in their failing to give a constant supply of water without waste The number of births registered during the year 1864 was 2,803, viz 1,473 males and 1,330 females The deaths were 2,792, viz 1,531 males and 1,261 females The deaths in the London Hospital of nonresidents, exclusive of those whpse death was occasioned by accident, were 225 The excess of births over deaths has been only 11; but if the deaths of the nonresidents are excluded, the excess of births over deaths is 236 In the preceding year the excess of births over deaths was 32 ; excluding the deaths of the nonresidents it was 213 During the past year 338 inquests were held against 291 in the previous year The uncertified deaths are 25 against 32 When such facilities exist for all persons obtaining gratuitous medical assistance, as is the case in this district, it is to be lamented that so many people die without having been attended by a qualified member of the medical profession The Medical Officers of the Union have attended 14,932 new cases of illness, exclusive of 3,112 in the Workhouse Last year the Medical Officers returned 14,564 cases among the outdoor poor, and 2,479 in the Workhouse On reviewing the sanitary condition of the district, as indicated by the annual increase of the number of deaths and cases of illness among the pauper population, I regret to have to report that the public health is very far from being in a satisfactory state, although great improvements have been effected in the drainage of the houses, particularly of those occupied by the poor,\xe2\x80\x94the more prompt removal of nuisances which is brought about by the regular and systematic inspection of all the poor localities,\xe2\x80\x94the improvement which has taken place in the water supply, and the better pavement which has been laid down in several of the courts and byeplaces In 1860 the mortality returns were 2,302, and the cases of illness among the pauper population 11,392; in 1861 the deaths were 2,331, and the cases of illness 13,724; in 1863 the deaths were 2,551, cases of illness 14,270 ; in 1863 (53 weeks), deaths 2,764, cases of illness 14,564; while in 1864 the deaths were 2,792, and the cases of illness 14,932 These returns are very significant, and they ought to engage our serious attention, with a view of accounting for this annual increase in the deaths Upwards of 3,400 cesspools have been destroyed since the formation of your Board 6 and in the number of cases of illness in the district, so that, if possible, remedies may be used to mitigate these calamities I have on former occasions stated, and I now repeat it, that we have no evidence to show that our population is increasing It is true that there has been an excess annually in the births over the deaths, which in eight years, from 1857 to 1864, has amounted to 2,425 This is at the average rate of annual increase of about 300 During the last three years, however, the excess of births over deaths has been only 305, which is at the rate of about 100 annually But in a migrating population, such as exists in this district, the excess of births over deaths will not be found to indicate that the population has increased; for, in 1857, I estimated, by adopting this mode of calculation, that our population was at that time upwards of 84,000, which, when the census papers were published, was found to be greatly in excess of the actual amount The population in 1841 was 71,879; in 1851 it increased to 79,756, which is at the rate of about 11 per 1,000 annually; while in 1861 the population decreased to 78,970, notwithstanding that the excess of births during the decennary had been annually much greater than it has been during the last four years The annual increase in the rate of mortality has not been confined to this district, but it prevailed over the entire metropolis Thus, in 1860 the deaths in London were 226 percent of the population; in 1861 they were 232; in 1862, 234; in 1863, 245; *and in 1864, 266 During the last twelve months very little rain has fallen; but how far this deficiency of moisture has been the cause of the increased mortality, it is, perhaps, impossible to assert with confidence Although the atmosphere was, by the long drought of last summer, deprived of the purifying influence of rain, which may, perhaps, in some measure account for the increase of mortality during this year, it will not account for the annual increase of the rate of mortality during the last four years It would be exceedingly gratifying to myself were I able to satisfactorily account for this annual increase in the number of deaths and cases of illness, but I must candidly confess my inability to do so I may, however, venture to offer a few conjectures upon the subject The first one that I would put forth as a not improbable cause of this increase of mortality is, that either the type of diseases has changed, or that a change has taken place in the constitution of the people, so that they are now less able to bear the effects of disease than formerly Those inflammatory diseases, for the cure of which large and frequent bleedings were practised, do not now come under the notice of medical men; or, if similar inflammatory diseases do occur, the patients are now unable to bear those depleting remedies formerly used Stimulating remedies, such as wine, brandy, and nutritious food, are now found to be absolutely necessary for the cure of a very large proportion of the diseases which attack the inhabitants of towns These remedies the mass of the people are unable to procure If, as is very probably the case, a change has The fall of rain in the year was only 167 in The average yearly fall is 253 in each of the years 1858 and 1847 the rain fall was 178 in 7 taken place in the physical condition of the people, so that they are now less able to bear up against the ravages of disease, they require for their well being a larger amount of nutritious food, fire, and clothing than formerly; and unless the weekly wages of the labouring classes have increased, they are unable to procure these necessaries in sufficient quantities The best kind of nutritious food, such as meat of good quality, has lately been so dear that many of the working classes are unable to purchase it Besides, much of the food, such as bread, oatmeal, &c, which is purchased by the poor, is largely adulterated with substances containing a very small amount of nutritious properties Milk, the chief, or at least that should be the chief article of food for children, is rarely to be purchased in its genuine state, being usually adulterated with half its weight of water Here then is a fertile source of disease in children The majority of children of the poor, and many of those belonging to the more wealthy classes, are not only underfed, but they are not sufficiently clothed There is very little danger to the health of a child by overfeeding, provided that plain food only be given to it Nature sets a limit to the quantity of food a child requires for its support by the withdrawal of the stimulus of appetite Many skin and parasitical diseases are frequently caused by a diet not sufficiently nutritious, and such diseases attack the children of the rich, although not so frequently as the children of the poor, but in both the cause is the same It is of the utmost importance to the well being of a child, both as regards its mental capacity and physical condition, that it should be not only fed with animal food twice a day, and be well clothed, but that it should breathe pure air; for, by providing it with these necessaries, we shall find that the fatality of the tubercular class of diseases will be greatly diminished, and a more robust race of men and women will grow up, thereby increasing the strength, and consequently the wealth of the nation Secondly, the hours of labour in certain businesses are too long, and more especially so where the rooms in which many of the young men and women employed in tailoring and similar occupations are overcrowded, badly ventilated, and lighted with gas Thirdly, the exposure of infants to the cold, and the administering to them of opium and other narcotics Fourthly, the increased mental labour which so many men engaged in business appear now to impose upon themselves, and the increased anxiety which attends the carrying on their mercantile transactions Various other causes are in operation, which I need not here particularize, whereby the health of the people is deteriorated I may, however, mention one more, viz, the breathing of the tainted atmosphere in the several places of entertainment, caused by their being charged with the products of the burning of an unnecessary large quantity of gas, and of the respiration of crowded audiences The atmosphere of many of the churches where gas is used has a very pernicious effect upon many persons The same remark applies to the injurious effect of burning gas in every room of a dwellinghouse, where adequate means are not provided for carrying away the vitiated air In conclusion, I may be permitted to remark, that we have much reason for 8 congratulating ourselves upon the sanitary improvements which have been effected in this district; for had a similar state of things existed now as it did formerly, instead of my having to record an increase of the death rate during the last three or four years of about 4 in 1,000 annually, a death rate of treble that amount might have taken place For the information of those members of the Board who were not acquainted with the physical condition of the district twenty years ago, I subjoin a description of the state of Blue Anchor Yard in 1846; and I may state, from my own personal knowledge, that some of the courts in Essex Street, now the site of Commercial Street, were in equally as bad a condition before the new street was formed I quote from a copy of my petition to the House of Lords, which was presented by the late Marquis of Normanby After alluding to the bad physical condition of several of the localities in Whitechapel Parish, and stating that not only had nothing been done to improve the condition of these places, but that they had been progressively getting worse and worse, it goes on to state, that in "Blue Anchor Yard, which is a street abounding with narrow courts, which it is scarcely possible for any one to penetrate, there being in the centre of the street an open gutter which is almost always full of putri fying matter, there are now, in addition, large holes, which, as well as the gutter, are constantly filled with all sorts of refuse and filth There is no footpath, and the houses, which are dilapidated, are filthy to the last degree\xe2\x80\x94 without drainage, without water, and without privies That among the houses in one of the small courts in this street, Cooper\'s Court, one was in such a dilapidated condition that it was necessary to take it down some time ago, and the site is now occupied by a large dunghill, formed of every description of refuse matter, mixed with the contents of privies, and the filth of adjoining pigsties, several of the rooms in the immediate neighbourhood of the court being inhabited by pigs Again, in Rose Court, another court in this street, some old dilapidated wooden houses, which formed one side of this court, have been recently pulled down Into the vacant space the contents of the privies of Crown Court empty themselves, forming a large reservoir of most filthy fluid, composed of the contents of the privies and rainwater, from which a noisome stench exhales, and into which the children, many of whom are always found at play near this dangerous spot, may readily fall, and perish instantaneously from suffocation" After the publication of this petition in some of the daily newspapers, the Trustees of Whitechapel Parish offered to the Ratcliff Commission, to which this street was adjacent, the sum of \xc2\xa3250 to take it under their jurisdiction This offer was accepted, and the Ratcliff Commission paved the street, and those courts which their respective landlords were willing to place under the control of the Board A sewer was soon after constructed in this street by the Tower Hamlets Commission of Sewers As regards the sanitary work performed during the year, I may state, among other things done, that all the courts in the district have been visited and reported upon by the Inspectors about once in every three weeks, by which 9 means nuisances have been discovered which had not, and perhaps never would have been complained of; and the consequence is that the sanitary defects which the Inspectors found in the several houses and localities have been for the most part remedied All the houses where fever cases were recorded in the books of the Medical Officers of the Union have likewise been inspected, and in nearly every case notice has been served upon the landlord to limewhite the room, and in some instances the entire house There are 170 public dustbins in the district, all of which are periodically examined by the Inspectors For neglect in not emptying these public dustbins twice every week the contractors are liable to a fine The slaughterhouses, cowhouses, and bakehouses have been several times inspected As regards slaughterhouses, I may here observe, that the clause of the Building Act relating to the prohibiting the opening of a new slaughterhouse has not been acted upon in this district since the first licensing day after the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, when the Board successfully opposed the granting of a license to one of the applicants upon the ground that it was a new application, and consequently contrary to the provisions of the Building Act Since then the Board has not deemed it advisable to oppose under that section any further application In St Pancras Parish, however, according to Dr Hillier\'s last Annual Report, the application for a license for a new slaughterhouse was refused by the Justices on the ground that the premises were within 50 feet of a dwellinghouse, and therefore, as a new application, was contrary to the provisions of the Building Act It was no doubt contemplated by the Legislature, when this clause of the Building Act was passed, that the privilege of slaughtering cattle in London should gradually be abolished The bakehouses, on inspection, were for the most part found to be clean ; and in no instance was there discovered to be one used contrary to the provisions of the Act Many of them are underground, which in a sanitary point of view is exceedingly objectionable, from the large quantity of carbonic acid which is evolved from the dough while undergoing the necessary fermentation, and from the gases equally destructible to health which frequently escape from the fires which heat the ovens These gases cannot readily escape, owing to the difficulty of properly ventilating those bakehouses which are situated underground I am sorry to say, that in only one instance in this district is the bread made by machinery The objectionable plan of kneading with the hands and arms is still practised I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant,

inhabitants were, in my opinion, well founded, for the smell from the factory was very offensive, and pervaded the neighbourhood to a considerable extent', ' The process of throwing water upon the heated charcoal ought to be abandoned, as the smell from this operation is very offensive, and is altogether unnecessary', '6\xc2\xb0 5 Water Supply Since my last Quarterly Report, a considerable addition has been made in the number of the water-waste preventers in this district There have been erected 20 new water-waste preventers within the last three months There are now, at the present time, 53 places supplied with water direct from the main, by means of these machines, and the inhabitants of these places can have pure water at all times of the day or night, in sufficient quantity for all household purposes In each of the undermentioned places a water-waste preventer has been erected since my last Quarterly Report: Hunt Court Gower\'s Place Keate Court Eele Place Garden Court New Court, C C Wilk Court Half Wilk Court Union Court, C C Coburg Court Crown Court, C C Pope\'s Head Court 35, Great Pearl St Devonshire Place Goulston St 9,10,11 Russell Court Holloway Court Slater\'s Court Crown Court, W C Kittleby Court The constant supply of water to the poor is one of the most valuable sanitary improvements that has been effected in this district since the formation of your Board The poor appear to fully appreciate the great boon that has been conferred upon them by this mode of supply; they have now in all these places an abundance of water, but it is without waste, so that, while they are benefitted, the Companies are not injured; and I have no doubt that, it will be found, less water is required to be delivered by the Companies under the new system than under the old plan of the standtap I am able to report that, both the Water Companies, which supply this district, are now willing, and I believe anxious, that all the courts should be supplied on the constant service, and that within the last six weeks, the New Eiver Company have granted permission to the owners of 10 courts in Blue Anchor Yard, to erect a water-waste preventer in each As only about an eighth part of this district is supplied by the New Eiver Company, the proportion of water-waste preventers will, when all these courts are supplied, be fully equal to that of the East London, and I have no doubt that, from the friendly co-operation of the Companies, the whole of the poor localities will be supplied on the constant service New Court, in Fashion Street, and Dale Court, are likewise supplied direct from the main; in the former, by means of an ordinary tap in the yard of each house, and in the latter by a small pipe, from which water is constantly flowing The total number of houses occupied by poor persons, which are supplied with water on the constant service, is about 583, which contain a population of about 4,664 In several courts, where the supply of water has 6 been deficient, landlords have preferred to erect large tanks or cisterns instead of water-waste preventers There are, however, still a few remaining courts, where the cisterns or butts are not sufficiently large, but even these will probably be soon supplied either with water-waste preventers or with larger receptacles The poorer parts of this district, which, a few years ago, were very badly supplied with water (there being no less than about 70 courts supplied on the intermittent system, by means of a standtap only), are now probably better provided than any other district in London There are still, however, two courts, in which water is supplied by means of a stand-tap, viz , Farthing Alley and Bond\'s Buildings, but as the houses consist of merely two rooms each, and are not let to more than one family, the owners cannot be compelled to register them Unless, therefore, the landlords of these two courts adopt, of their own free will, the improved mode of supply, their tenants must put up with the inconvenience they suffer, from want of an adequate supply of water, for the Board has not sufficient power to compel the owners to erect water-waste preventers The New River Company have, through their chief engineer, stated that, "they have often intimated their desire to work with medical officers for improvements in the water supply to the poor," and "they have arranged in not a few cases for the constant service," and state that " they are quite prepared on the single condition of effective provision being made against waste, to add to the number of main supplies " They further add, "that it is in this Company\'s interest (as it is manifestly the interest of all Water Companies) to promote the adoption of any good kind of wastepreventing apparatus " The East London Water Company have expressed their desire in similar terms, to extend the system of constant supply It is, therefore, manifest that if the poor in this district are not adequately supplied with water direct from the main, the fault will not be with the Companies, and the same remark will probably apply to all the other districts of London The inhabitants of those houses which are supplied with water stored in butts in the back yards or in the cellars, when there are no back yards, are, generally speaking, very badly off for water; for the butts, being common to all the tenants in the house, are generally in a dirty condition, as it is the duty of no one in particular to keep them clean and covered, consesequently, the water becomes covered with dirt and soot, and is unfit for drinking purposes When the butt is, from want of a back yard, placed in the cellar, it is usually found to be in close proximity to the privy, the emanations from which contaminate the water, and render it unwholesome The water is further contaminated by each tenant dipping any sort of utensil at hand into the butt, this being the only way of obtaining water, as the butt is not provided with a tap 7 House Accommodation The house accommodation, although in numerous cases it has been generally improved, is still far from being in a satisfactory condition Many of the houses are without back yards, and the inhabitants of the rooms in such houses (some of them being three stories high) are compelled to descend into the cellar for all the water that is required for culinary, drinking, and washing purposes In other houses, where there are back yards, the tenants have to descend into the cellar, and then ascend steps on the other side, in order to use the privy, or to fetch water, in consequence of the passage of the house having been taken to enlarge the lower room Again, there are some cases where the inhabitants are compelled to carry all the filth of their rooms along the public street, and then convey it into a court at the rear of their tenements, and deposit it, either in the public dust-bin, or in the common privy, there being neither privy nor dust-bin in the house Further, owing to the landlords of some houses being desirous of making the most of their property, and not being controlled by any public authority, have done away with the passage through the cellar, and instead of converting the lower room into a passage, have made a door leading from it to the back yard, so that the persons occupying the upper part of the house have to pass through this dwelling-room in carrying their slops and other refuse into the back yard These several remarks apply to some houses in Crown Court, Aldgate; Wentworth Street, adjoining Marlborough Court; to Nos 79, 80, and 81, Church Street, Mile End New Town; Nos 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 21, King Edward Street, and Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, Pelham Street The cellars in King Edward Street are less than 5 feet in height, are damp and unpaved, and the way to, and from them, is by a step ladder at each end of the cellar Each of the six houses in Pelham Street is now let to a separate family; but if at any future time these houses should be occupied as formerly, by separate families, those living in the upper rooms will have to pass through the lower rooms in order to go into the back yard The knowledge of such facts as above recorded relating to the manner in which the poor are lodged, and they are by no means all that can be collected upon this subject, must compel thoughtful persons not to judge too hastily of the rude manners, want of cleanliness, and of self-respect among the poor; for I would ask, how can cleanliness, decency, and self - respect be observed when persons are virtually without water (owing to the labour of obtaining it), and are compelled to carry the filth of their rooms either through a dwelling-room, occupied by another family, or along the public street, or through a low, and almost inaccessible and dark cellar? It is 8 surely the duty of the legislature to insist upon the owners of property let in tenements to the poor to provide them with the means of practising the decencies of civilized life It would, indeed, be well for society, if more attention were given by those in authority to the means of preventing disease, and its consequences\xe2\x80\x94pauperism; for, if this were done, we should not have, to the same extent, these periodical returns of destitution, which we have lately seen in the East of London Much of it might be prevented if more attention were paid to the condition of the abodes of the poor, whereby their health might be better preserved The systematic house to house visitation, adopted in this district, is continually bringing to light the indecent manner in which rooms are occupied, and the frequency of the stoppage of the house-drains, pipes of the privies, and also the want of efficient privy accommodation, especially for children As regards the first-mentioned evil, I almost despair of being able to get it remedied It may be, however, to a certain extent, mitigated, by compelling the owners of houses so occupied to register them, when they will be compelled to observe the eighth section of the regulations of the Board, respecting the separation of the sexes in lodging houses: and, as regards the frequent stoppage of the privies, I am of opinion, that a better arrangement is required for these conveniences than the syphon-pan and trap now in use A good plan has been adopted at the Shoe Black Society in Mansell Street, and at the large Jews\' School in Bell Lane, Spitalfields, for carrying off the filth from privies It consists in placing what may be called, by way of distinction, "a trough water-closet," instead of the trap and pan system The trough water-closet is an ordinary seat placed over a highlyglazed earthenware trough, filled with water The trough is so fixed as to afford a sufficient incline for it to be quickly emptied into the drain by the removal of a plug When the trough is emptied (which it should be at least once or twice a day), it should then be immediately re-filled with water If this rule were observed there would be no nuisance from bad smells From the simplicity of the apparatus, it would seldom get out of order, and it would be found to be more economical than the present system of the syphon-pans and traps Small seats for children over this trough should be provided Metropolitan Buildings and Management Bill A Bill under the above designation was, in the course of the last Session of Parliament, prepared and brought in by Mr Tite and Colonel Hogg, and was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed, 31st July, 1867 If this Bill should become an Act, all the existing Building Acts will be repealed It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the several provisions of the Bill should be considered, and a few important clauses relating to public health inserted 9 The Bill contains numerous clauses relating to the construction of buildings, and it duly sets forth the duties of District Surveyors, and the providing for their fees, &c , but the clauses relating to sanitary matters are few and insufficient In other words, the rights and security of property are fully considered; but regulations to provide for improving the health of the people, do not appear to have much engaged the attention of the promoters of the Bill As I have repeatedly pointed out in several of my printed Reports, and in a Paper published in the "Builder," and in the "Building News," for December 28th, 1861, the sanitary defects of the existing Building Acts, and have also drawn the attention of the Architect to the Metropolitan Board, to several cases in which houses unfit for habitation have been permitted to be erected in this district, I had reason to hope that a few mora of my suggestions for improving the sanitary condition of houses to be erected in the future, would have been considered, and provisions made for carrying them into effect, by the promoters of the present Bill Under the existing law, houses can be enlarged by what is called "a lean-to," although it may so prevent the due entrance of light and air, as to render them unhealthy It seems to be an established practice that, as regards house property, every person should be allowed "to do what he likes with his own," and make as much money as possible out of it, although in doing so, he totally disregards the health, comfort, and decency, of those unfortunate persons who may be compelled to occupy it The evils of the present mode of crowding together dwelling-houses, and the covering of every available small space with additional rooms to existing houses, will, unless prevented by stringent powers in the proposed new Building Act, greatly increase, and especially so, if at any future time, a general poor rate should be levied over the entire metropolis; for it will then be to the interest of the keepers of small shops in poor neighbourhoods to give encouragement to any plan that will tend to bring together large masses of the people Although this Bill contains no less than 254 clauses, there is not one which prescribes rules for the proper construction of either privies, waterclosets, or ash-pits In short, these essential appendages to a house have not been mentioned It is true, that the Metropolis Local Management Act requires that every house shall have a sufficient privy and ash-pit belonging to it; yet, that Act does not provide that these conveniences shall be within the curtilage of the house, and to be of easy access to all the tenants; and there is no power vested in any authority to prevent the erection of a privy in an open court, to be common, not only to all the tenants of the court, and perhaps so placed as to be within a few feet of a dwelling-room, and accessible to the general public Wherever these public privies exist, of which there are several in this district (some haying been erected since the 10 tion of the Board), they are perpetually recurring nuisances, and in some instances, from their close proximity to inhabited rooms, render such rooms unfit for habitation This is the case in Jones\' Buildings If these nuisances cannot be dealt with by our present powers, it is certainly full time that the extension of them was prohibited by legislative enactment How the health of the people of Nottingham is provided for, as far as the building of houses is concerned, may be seen by the underquoted clause of an Act of Parliament, which was obtained by the authorities of that town, in 1845 The act is 8 & 9 Vict , cap 7, clause 124 "And for the purpose of insuring the admission of light and air to and amongst the buildings which may be hereafter erected within the limits of this Act, and for the purpose of preventing the unhealthy and inconvenient overcrowding of the dwellings of the poor, and for the purpose of securing due accommodation and privacy, be it enacted, That no dwelling-house shall adjoin any other dwelling-house or other building (except an outhouse ordinarily occupied with such dwelling-house) on more than two sides, and that every dwellinghouse shall be provided with an attached yard or garden, (separate and distinct from any other yard or garden) to extend at the least to a distance of thirty feet from such dwelling-house, or so much on each of the two opposite or adjacent sides of such dwelling-house as shall together extend at the least to thirty feet, and that every dwelling-house shall have within its own curtilage or garden a separate privy, or water-closet, and dust-pit "* Although in London it would not be possible to obtain so much ground at the rear or side of houses erected for the poor as is provided at Nottingham, yet the law should make it incumbent upon all persons erecting dwelling houses, to provide a thorough ventilation for every house, and should prohibit the building of houses back to back The proposed new Building Act not only very imperfectly provides for the efficient ventilation of houses, but actually sanctions the building of houses back to back As we are now so severely suffering, both in health and pocket, from the neglect of the legislature in years gone by, in permitting the erection of houses unfit for human habitation, advantage should be taken of any Bill brought before the Houses of Parliament for amending the Budding Act, to prevent the further erection of unhealthy dwellings The unhealthy houses which are to be found in all the poor localities in London, may be gradually purchased and pulled down, under the provisions of the Artizans\' and Labourers\' Dwelling Bill, should such Bill become an Act But unless the proposed New Building Act is sufficiently stringent in its provisions to prohibit the erection of unhealthy dwellings in the future, very little benefit will accrue to the public by abolishing existing nuisances, when similar ones * Sec Dr Hunter\'s Report on the Housing of the Poor in Towns, published in the Eighth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Privy Council, page 161 11 may with impunity be set up The Metropolitan Board of Works has now the power of doing a vast amount of good, towards improving the health of people, and the public will certainly expect them to perform it I have on a former occasion drawn your attention to the unhealthy condition of underground bakehouses, owing to the impossibility of providing for their proper ventilation Many of the bakehouses in this district are situated under the footways of the pulbic streets, so that if at any time it should be deemed advisable to form sub-ways, for gas and water pipes, telegraph wires, &c , the owners of such bakehouses must be compensated In a new Building Act, it ought surely to be deemed expedient to insert a clause prohibiting the formation of a bakehouse under the public way In no instance should the public way be sacrificed for the benefit of any individual Sanitary Work Performed during the Quarter The following return shows the amount of work done by the Sanitary Inspectors during the quarter Number of houses visited, as shown in the official returns 8532 Houses systematically visited and rooms measured to ascertain their cubic capacity 605 Number of rooms

forwarded to the police authorities several notices of dangerous structures, and they have also informed them of the various rooms, in the course of the special visitations, which have been found to be occupied by more than one family In such cases, the police can proceed against the landlords under the Common Lodging-House Act, Annual Report The number of deaths registered in this district, during the year 1867, has been 2331, and the number of births 2686 The deaths, in 1866, were 3495 In this number there are included 904 deaths from cholera The births, in 1866, were 2561 The deaths in the Workhouse have been 331, against 413 for the previous year, and in the London Hospital 445 against 733 The total deaths from Epidemic Diseases have been 362, viz 40 from small-pox, 33 from measles, 26 from scarlet fever and diphtheria, 72 from hooping-cough, 100 from diarrhoea, 82 from fever, and 9 from cholera and choleraic diarrh\xc5\x93a Estimating the population at 78,000, the rate of mortality from all causes has been 29 per 1000, or 1 in 34 of all living But as there is a large hospital situated within this district, into which institution patients are received, not only from all the districts in London, but from many parts of the country, the registered rate of mortality of the Whitechapel District is in excess of its actual amount In comparing the rate of mortality with other districts, the whole of the deaths in the London Hospital must be eliminated, and all the districts in London, in which a public hospital is situated, must, in estimating their rate of mortality, adopt the same rule, and the deaths in all the hospitals must be fairly apportioned to each district The rate of mortality in this district, after deducting the deaths in the London Hospital, is 24 per 1000, or 1 in 41 of the total population * Bett\'s Yard, Buttress Gardens, Barber\'s Yard, Brunswick Place, Bell Place, Brownson\'s Court, Crown Court in Wentworth Street, Crown

have been taken down for improvements; and, as there is scarcely any vacant ground in the district, very few new houses can be erected, but as several of the large houses have been vacated by the single families which formerly occupied them, are now let out in tenements, the population has not decreased in proportion to the number of houses taken down In the next census, it would be desirable to enumerate the number of inhabited rooms, as well as the number of inhabited houses in the district Sanitary Work Performed during the Year 1867 The following return shows the amount of work done by

Trades\' Nuisances The following trades\' nuisances have come under the notice of the Board during the year, and the greater part of them have been either entirely removed or greatly abated The Animal

Malt Roasting in Booth Street, the Malt Roasting in Bell Lane, the Animal Charcoal Refinery in Rupert Street As regards the nuisance arising from the Refinery Premises of Sir Anthony Rothschild, I regret to be obliged to report that very little has been done to abate it At times this nuisance is as bad as it was many years ago 14 Sewers Constructed in the District since 1857 The Surveyor, at my

control of the Central Board and the several Local Boards The whole system of the sewerage of London should have been under the management of only one public authority Many of the sewers, as regards their levels, are so badly constructed, that it would have been better, and probably cheaper to the rate-payers, if all such sewers had been so reconstructed as to suit the present outfall into the river Some of the existing sewers hold a large quantity of deposit, and are always emitting most offensive effluvia In several parts of this district, the sewers are very offensive, and are frequently complained of, particularly those in Church Lane and Back Church Lane Vaults under Spitalfields Church In my Report for the Quarter ending December, 1859, I reported that the Order in Council requiring that the vaults under Whitechapel Church, Trinity Minories Church, and the Lutheran Chapel, in Hooper Square, should be freely lime-whited\xe2\x80\x94that the coffins in the vaults be covered with fresh earth and powdered charcoal, &c , had been complied with; but, with regard to the vaults beneath Spitalfields Church, respecting their ventilation and extent, Mr Grainger, the then Government Inspector, deemed it sufficient to order that the several gratings opening into Church Street, and the grating opening opposite the Rectory, should be closed, which orders were duly complied with Mr P H Holland, the present Inspector, appointed under the powers of the Burial Act, 1855, inspected these vaults in August last, and, in consequence of his report, an Order of the Privy Council, dated the 2nd of February, 1867, was issued, directing that the coffins then unenclosed beneath the church be embedded in soil, mingled with charcoal, and enclosed either by concrete, or by stone-work, or brick-work properly cemented The very satisfactory manner in which this Order has been executed, is shown in the following report of Mr S J Hyam,the Vestry Clerk of Spitalfields Parish "At the time of Mr Holland\'s visit (in consequence of the decay of the large water-pipes, conveying water from the roof of the church) the crypt was in a very unpleasant state from damp, which, by its action upon the coffins, increased the effluvia that escaped from the mass of human remains there deposited Some years previously, nearly all the window openings into the crypt had been built up, pursuant to an Order in Council; bo that, in addition to other evils, the place was quite dark, and almost without ventilation 16 "The preparation of the Specification, and the settling of the requisite arrangements, having delayed the matter until late in the Spring, the work was not commenced until September, and occupied until Christmas last The following is a statement of the works that have been performed The public vault was cleared, leaving a space of six feet, from the ceiling to the top of the coffins;\xe2\x80\x94the remaining coffins were covered with earth two feet thick, and upon this was spread a layer of charcoal, six inches thick \xe2\x80\x94 four air flues made, leading from the upper part of the six-feet space into four of the large air flues in the walls, so that any effluvia escaping through the earth, and not absorbed by the charcoal, will ascend to the roof of the church All the vaults in the thickness of the north and south walls, and the vault in the east wall, have been cleared, and thoroughly disinfected, the entrances bricked-up in cement, and the exterior face of the brick-work well cemented The eastern half of the crypt has been cleared of all the vaults and coffins, and thoroughly disinfected; the old brick pavement removed, and the ground levelled and covered with concrete six inches thick So with regard to the vaults at the east end, and at the north-west corner, of the crypt; the large vault beneath the steps at the west end, and the upper chamber beneath the tower All the walls surrounding the remains of the dead have been covered with Portland cement, and all the open portions of the crypt and vaults, twice well lime-whited All the closed window spaces that could be so treated, have been re-opened; the thick wooden entrance-doors of the crypt replaced with light iron gates, so as to permit thorough ventilation; and the old, useless drains, have been taken up The works have been executed in the best manner; and before the vaults were finally closed, they were inspected by the Medical Officer of Health All the coffins, and the remains of the dead, that were removed to effect these improvements, are deposited in the crypt; some in the spaces on each side of the public vault; some in the lower vaults at the east end, and in the large vault at the west end beneath the tool-house \xe2\x80\x94 in the vault beneath the same, and in the corridors leading therefrom In removing the coffins, every care was taken to avoid any injury thereto; and the remains found in the decayed and imperfect coffins, were placed in wooden cases, provided for the purpose In the large vault, at the south-west corner of the church, were found three ancient, British, stone coffins These have been removed into the crypt, where they may be inspected The other coffins were arranged in the vault, and covered with earth, charcoal, and with concrete, and the entrances thereto built up "It is computed that at least 150 cubic yards of clean earth, free from lumps and animal deposits, and 150 bushels of charcoal, were used to cover up the coffins beneath the church 17 "The works were carried out under the immediate direction of the churchwardens, Mr R Arnold, Mr Brookman, and Mr "Woollven, and subject to the supervision of Mr J Liddle, the Medical Officer of Health Mr James Tolley, of Angel Court, Throgmorton Street, was the Surveyor, and Mr Temple G Tolley, the Contractor The total outlay, nearly \xc2\xa3500, will be defrayed out of the poor-rates of the Parish Notwithstanding their large money-cost, the value of the works performed, as an important sanitary improvement, cannot be over-estimated "The total number of dead bodies which had been buried in the vaults under Spitalfields Church, has been estimated at 1500, viz , about 900 in the public vault, and 600 in the several private vaults It is probable that the number of coffins has been understated, for, as the work proceeded, many more were found, that had not been taken into account when the contract was accepted A majority of the vaults were constructed during the building of the church, and many are built in the thickness of the walls There are also several other vaults similarly constructed They were opened for interments in 1728 The public vault remained open for sepulture until 1845, and all the other vaults were finally closed in 1859 The public vault was crammed with coffins, from the floor to the ceiling; some of \'the coffins were found packed in the upright position, others sideways, while others again were placed in the customary manner "The crypt is 150 feet in length, 50 feet in width, and 12 feet 6 inches in height; it is light, and well ventilated, and is now open for the inspection of any member of the Board " I

Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more upto date design will I hope eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil OVERCROWDING\xe2\x80\x94Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2 Subsection 1 (e) of the Public Health (London) Act 1891 and during the year

Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1921 consisted of 17819 cartloads of street sweepings and slops and 46541 loads of house and trade refuse a total of 64360 loads The total for the year 1920 was 61236 The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September 1905 since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett\'s Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch

COURTS\xe2\x80\x94There are 89 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City the walls of which unless cleansed frequently become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of

Every effort was made by your officers to impress on householders in the City the necessity for the observance of such precautions as cleanliness frequent removal of house and other refuse and the prevention of access of flies to foodstuffs especially milk Leaflets were also distributed throughout the City directing attention to the danger created by the fly and enlarging on the precautionary

closed so that the smell is not now so much complained of', " Owing to repeated complaints from the inhabitants in a certain locality in the Borough of offensive smells from the sewers the Council appointed a Sub-Committee, consisting of members of the Public Health and Highways Committees, to consider the whole question This Sub-Committee instructed the Surveyors and myself to report to them on the matter, and these reports were as follows:\xe2\x80\x94 Surveyors' Report", ' As instances of this there are many systems of combined back drainage in the Borough and on some estates interceptors have been introduced on the main drains, as well as on the branches, there have been many complaints, and not without cause, as to smells from the surface gratings in the streets on such estates, but by taking out the stoppers from the cleansing eye of these interceptors and thus allowing the through current of air between the sewer and the combined main drain, which latter is ventilated at its highest point, the nuisance in nearly every case has been removed', ' The ventilation of sewers is a subject that has for many years engaged the attention of sanitarians, and many appliances have been invented to deodorise or destroy the effluvium which indisputably exists in many sewers, but these have not in any instance proved satisfactory', '\xe2\x80\x94Do you receive many

Garratt Lane main sewer the odour at some times was very overpowering and there is no doubt in my mind that the sewer gas from this main sewer, instead of following the main course of the water, ascends from the low levels to the branch sewers at higher levels, causing offensive odours in streets at a distance from such sewer', ' If offensive odours are being given off then the sewer at that part should be flushed and cleansed, as the presence of sewer gas shows that a deposit has taken place and consequent decomposition', ' The smell may be bottled up or discharged at higher levels, but nothing short of the removal of the causes will be satisfactory from a sanitary aspect', ' In favour of this policy is the fact of the complaints of nuisances\xe2\x80\x94smells\xe2\x80\x94 from these

likely to occur, no definite rule can be laid down for erecting shafts on the sewage system, therefore the plan of closing road gratings that may be reasonably complained of and the erection of shafts in their place is at present the best method'], '1878': [' The depth of water in these several premises varied from a few inches to three feet and more in depth, and upon the subsidence of the water a

Organised in 1970 are now working very satisfactorily as individual units, However, owing to there being a 25 per cent, shortage in the qualified inspectorate during the year, the programmes of work which had been designed for the divisions have had to be shelved until such time as staff are available to implement them, It has become obvious that the use of technical assistants has come to stay and plans were commenced during the year for their training at Colleges of Further Education, The General Division carried on its usual but nonetheless essential day-to-day task of dealing with routine complaints and during the year a marked increase was noticed in the number of complaints concerning accumulations of refuse and rubbish dumped in alleyways and on vacant sites, Other complaints which were dealt with by this division related to gipsies, to mice and, in particular, to the smell from a glucose factory in York Road (locally referred to as the \'Battersea smell\'), Much has been said and written about this factory, but, at the close of the year, it was obvious that all the publicity, via the media of the press and television, had achieved more than any statutory notices could have done in bringing the problem nearer to a final solution, The gipsies, however, are a different story, and although attempts were made to find a site, the one which was offered to them did not meet with their approval, and consequently the solution to this problem has been severely delayed, Complaints about mice also increased considerably and one of the worst problems was on the Doddington Road Estate, Following a detailed survey, the floors had to be taken up and pipe ducts sealed off in order to contain the mice and stop them travelling throughout the block, Once this work had been carried out, the rodent operatives were able to eradicate the infestation, During the year, this borough participated with other London Boroughs in a mouse survey which was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and much credit is due here to the rodent officers of the Health Department for their work in this respect, 42 The drainage section also bad a full year\'s work, the number of applications being received far exceeding that of any previous year, mainly due to the tremendous drive going on throughout the borough for house improvement, The Food Division, unfortunately, was hampered by lack of staff and the fact that, during the year, the divisional inspector obtained an appointment with another Authority, Consequently, until he was replaced by Mr,N,V,Saunders from Harrow, the division was running with two inspectors against the establishment of five, Very little routine revisiting was therefore carried out during the year, the inspectors being fully occupied in dealing with complaints and sampling duties, The Housing Division increased its success of the previous year and exceeded all expectations in the number of inspections made, They were also hampered by the lack of qualified technical staff and by the fact that technical assistants joining during the year had to be trained, In spite of this, the division virtually completed all the surveys in the slum clearance programme and made further inroads into properties in multiple occupation, Statistically, the year was very little different from any other, and although the enthusiasm of the younger inspectors still pervades, the shortage of staff and the concomitant increase of work inevitably puts more strain on those available, Tribute must be paid this year not only to the technical staff for their output despite staff shortages but also to the administrative staff for their support during this difficult period, Environmental pollution has, over the last few years, been afforded increased publicity nationally, The public, quite rightly, are becoming aware that chemical pollution of soil, water and air, by both industry and the essential services, together with noise from aircraft, are conditions which were accepted by our forbears as part of life but which now should no longer be tolerated, These expressions of concern by the public were borne home to the inspectors many times during the year when they gave lectures and informal talks to various local groups such as scouts, guides, schoolchildren and the staffs of hospitals and multiple stores, It is becoming obvious that the Environmental Health Section will have to widen its field of operation in the future with the individual divisions being broken down into specialist sections, The role which the public health inspector has played for the last 100 years of being a "Jack of all trades" is fast disappearing and taking on that of a specialist in one particular field, 43 PUBLIC HEALTH

proceedings were taken by the Council in 64 instances in connection with the abatement of nuisances, Drainage work Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing premises and drainage in connection with conversion schemes are carried out under the supervision of technical assistants of the department in co-ordination with the public health inspectors, Plans are required to be submitted to the Council for approval under the drainage by-laws and during the year 928 applications were received, 45 There were 3,634 tests made in connection with drainage installations and 54 connections made to the Council\'s sewers during the year, The clearance and maintenance of public sewers is the responsibility of the Council and maintenance costs are reclaimed from owners of properties connected to the public sewer, A close working liaison with the Technical Services Department implements the rapid clearance and repairs of public sewers, Sewerage and sewage disposal The trunk sewers and sewage disposal of London are the responsibility of the Greater London Council, and the local sewers which discharge into the trunk sewers are the responsibility of the Borough Councils, The Council\'s brick and pipe sewers are regularly cleansed and are reasonably adequate for their purpose, Water supply The bulk of the water supply in Wandsworth, as in other Inner London Boroughs, is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board who are responsible for its purity, Water supplies from this and other sources proved satisfactory both in quality and quantity throughout the year, All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine; after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilled; samples of water are then collected from these treated mains, and the mains are returned to service only after the analytical results are found to be satisfactory, The quality control from the Metropolitan Water Board\'s laboratories is carried out by means of daily sampling from the sources of supply, from the treatment works or well stations, from the distribution system and through to the consumer, Any sign of contamination or any other abnormality is immediately investigated, All dwellings in the borough, numbering approximately 127,000 and catering for a resident population of 302,258, were supplied from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board, No houses were permanently supplied by standpipe, 46 No artificial fluoride is added to the water supply by the Board and where the fluoride content is indicated in the analyses it represents the naturally occurring fluoride in the water, The natural fluoride content of the mains water was 0,20 parts per million, There has been no change in policy on the question of the general fluoridation of the water supply in Wandsworth, The Council has already made a decision in favour of fluoridation but the Metropolitan Water Board will take no action until all the authorities whose areas are served by the Board are similarly in favour, Nursing homes The Council controls the registration and supervision of all nursing homes within the Borough, and its powers in this connection are contained in the following Acts and Regulations:- Public Health Act, 1936, Nursing Homes Act, 1963, The Conduct of Nursing Homes Regulations, 1963, and, for mental nursing homes:- Mental Health Act, 1959, The Mental Health (Registration and Inspection of Mental Nursing Homes) Regulations, 1960, The Conduct of Mental Nursing Homes Regulations, 1962, Periodic visits are made to all the homes by the Department\'s medical and nursing officers and public health inspectors and, in addition to the supervision of the nursing care provided and of the sanitary arrangements in the homes, there is a close liaison between the Department\'s staff and that of the Superintending Architect of the Greater London Council and the London Fire Brigade\'s Fire Prevention Officers to ensure that fire precautions and means of escape in case of fire are at all times satisfactory, There were five nursing homes in the Borough at the end of the year, with a total of 203 beds, Their categories and accommodation are given below, together with the number of inspections made during the year- Mental nursing home (1) ,,, ,,, 117 beds Mother and baby home (1),,, ,,, 17 beds Other nursing homes (3) ,,, ,,, 69 beds Inspections by medical and nursing officers 8 Inspections by public health inspectors ,,, 6 47 Hairdressers and barbers The provisions made under Section 21 of the Greater London (General Powers) Act, 1967, state that no person may carry on a business as a hairdresser or barber at any premises unless he is registered in respect of those premises by the Borough Council; 235 such premises are registered with this Authority, A total of 197 visits were made by technical assistants during the year in connection with the work of registration and the enforcement of existing bye-laws which lay down standards of cleanliness in hairdressers\' establishments, In view of the increase in the use of wigs, hairdressers and wigmakers were warned of the dangers of using benzine, cartx>n tetrachloride and trichloroethylene for cleaning wigs, except in the open air or in well-ventilated rooms, The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act gives the Council power to require steps to be taken to eradicate and, where possible, to prevent infestation by rats and mice, These duties are carried out by the pest control officer assisted by four rodent operatives, All infestations coming to light, whether by complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated and appropriate action taken, Where the cause of the trouble is obviously a defective drain or other structural defect in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs, This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the rodent control staff and the public health inspectors, During the year, 3,947 complaints of infestation were received in respect of which a total of 10,050 visits were made by the staff, Again, more than two-thirds of these complaints related to the presence of mice, whereas those concerning rats have again decreased, The increase in mice complaints is disturbing and various methods, including the old-fashioned mouse trap, have been used, In addition to the work of rodent control, the pest control officer continued to carry out evening " forays" on pigeons roosting under railway bridges in the Borough, The bridges are a favourite breeding ground and by attacking the pigeons at their roosting sites profitable results have been obtained, over 1,000 birds and eggs being taken during the year, 48 Offensive trades There is one establishment in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat-melting is carried on, The firm concerned has been established for many years and the trade is conducted satisfactorily, Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 This Act is chiefly concerned with the distribution by sale or otherwise of poisonous substances, The list of poisons is contained in an Order made under the Act and is divided into two parts, The Council are not concerned with the poisons contained in Part 1 since an "authorised seller" is a pharmacist registered with the Pharmaceutical Society and enforcement is entrusted to Inspectors appointed by that Society, Substances specified in Part II may be sold by "listed sellers", and these are persons who, on written application in a prescribed form, and on payment of stated fees, are recorded by the Council as "persons entitled to sell poisons in Part II of the Poisons List" at the premises recorded in the Register, The Council are required to enforce the Act and Orders so far as they relate to "listed sellers" and have appointed the Public Health Inspectors as Inspectors under the Act, At the end of the year there were 128 persons registered under the Act, and 158 visits were made to the premises, Under the Poisons Rules (No,2) Order, 1968, the following fees to be paid by listed sellers of Part II poisons are authorised:- (a) for entry of name in the Corporation\'s list, \xc2\xa31,25, (b) for retention of name in the Corporation\'s list, 75p each year, Consumer Protection Act, 1961 The majority of the provisions of this Act and the Regulations made thereunder are enforced by the public health inspectors, Particular attention was given during the year to secure compliance with the Oil Heater Regulations at premises selling secondhand oil heaters and to ensure that unsafe heaters were not on sale, Reports were received from the Fire Authority during the year concerning fires, some of which were caused by oil heaters that did not comply with the Regulations, Retailers were 49 advised only to offer for sale oil heaters which bore a B,S,I, mark and specified warning notice, Attention was also paid to secondhand gas and electric fires on sale to ensure that they complied with the Fireguard Regulations, Noise Abatement Act, 1960 During the year, 119 complaints concerning noise were received and investigated by the public health inspectors, Many of these complaints were again concerning laundrettes, particularly self-operated laundrettes which are often open until a very late hour, The investigation by the inspectors in connection with these complaints has necessitated their visiting the premises in question often in the very early hours of the morning, during the evening and very late at night, This type of work outside normal working hours does put a considerable burden upon the inspectorate involved, In addition, one visit to these premises is by no means enough, and investigations are often very drawn out in trying to decide whether the best practicable means have been taken to reduce the noise, at least to a reasonable level, Noise other than industrial noise is very difficult to deal with, as it is often of an intermittent character, For example, the sounding of chimes by ice-cream vendors after hours is an offence, but unless an inspector or the police are on the spot at the time the offence is committed, no prosecution can be taken, The Act does provide, however, for any three persons aggrieved by a noise nuisance to initiate action by complaining to the Local Authority, I must again thank the Scientific Branch of the Greater London Council for the assistance which they have given to the inspectors during the past year in recording and making observations on various noise nuisances, Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 The work of administering the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act is the responsibility of the Council\'s Chief Public Health Inspector, specialist public health inspectors and tachnical assistants, Despite a shortage of specialist public health inspectors during the year under review, the inspection of premises registered under the Act has proceeded in a methodical manner, 50 Registration,\xe2\x80\x94 Registration of most premises is only effected after an initial visit by the inspectors and there is still ignorance by occupiers as to their duties in this respect, National publicity could be valuable as a means of reminding potential occupiers of their responsibilities in this direction, General,\xe2\x80\x94 Compliance with most parts of the Act continues to be satisfactory but many occupiers only take action to comply with all aspects of the Act following pressure from the Local Authority; thus systematic inspection still continues to be necessary, and without regular visits to premises standards would undoubtedly fall, Planning,- During the year, particular attention has been given to the examination of plans of proposed offices, shops and warehouses, and many observations have been made so that the building, or addition to the building, will comply with all relevant legislation from the moment of occupation, It is regretted that so much space is often devoted to the sales area of shops, and minimal consideration is given to staff needs, and inspectors find such conditions as assistants standing about in passages to get a few minutes morning or afternoon break, Most of the larger firms provide very satisfactory rest room facilities and it is to be hoped that future legislation will insist on at least a heated well-lit corner of the premises away from the public being reserved for staff rest periods, Hoists and Lifts Regulations,- Since the Regulations require an inspection of the lift to be made at six-monthly or yearly intervals by a competent person it would seem that, if the report on its condition is unsatisfactory, a certificate stating the required work had been completed should be sent to the Local Authority following a reinspection by the competent person, It is suggested that new proposed legislation should cover the submission of such a report, During the past year, the enforcement of the Act in this borough has proceeded purposefully and considerable improvement has again occurred in a wide variety of premises during 1972, The following table shows the classification and number of premises registered at the end of 1972, the number of persons employed and the number of inspections and other visits made during the year;- 51 TABLE 10 Class of premises Number registered Persons employed General inspections Revisits or other visits Offices 967 14,437 780 964 Retail shops 1,811 8,123 976 2,481 Wholesale shops, warehouses 113 1,179 54

the City of London Corporation whereby that Authority\'s veterinary officer carries out inspections of premises in respect of which applications have been made for licences under the various Animal Protection Acts, The main Acts under which action was taken during the year are as follows:- Pet Animals Act, 1951,- A pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the object of which is to regulate the sale of pet animals with particular reference to their welfare whilst being kept for sale, 28 licences were issued by the Council during 1972, Animal Boarding Establishments Act, 1953,\xe2\x80\x94 This Act provides that no person may keep a boarding establishment for animals (defined as cats or dogs) in the Borough except under licence, Two such licences were granted during the year, Riding Establishments Acts, 1964 and 1970,- These Acts provide for the licensing and inspection of any establishment at which a business of keeping horses for hire, for riding or for providing riding instruction is carried on, Licences in respect of two riding establishments were granted, 52 Animals (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1957,- Under the terms of this Order, the following Orders of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were advertised in the \'National Press\':- Newcastle Disease (England and Wales) Order 1971, Brucellosis (Eradication Areas) Orders, Brucellosis (Area Eradication) Orders, Diseases of Animals (Approved Disinfectants)(Amendment) Order 1972, Tuberculosis (Compensation) Amendment Order 1972, Diseases of Animals (Miscellaneous Fees) Order 1972, Live Poultry (Restrictions) Amendment Order 1972, Foot and Mouth Disease (Infected Areas)(Vaccination) Order 1972, Land Charges Act, 1925 During the year, the\'Department dealt with 9,652 enquiries relating to local land charges These enquiries necessitate a careful search of records and drainage plans, to ascertain the existence of any orders or restrictions on the properties concerned such as outstanding statutory or informal notices, certificates of disrepair under the Rent Acts, inclusion in housing development programmes or slum clearance areas, Common lodging houses There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough, New legislation The following Regulations came into force during the current year- Poisons (Amendment) Rules 1971 (SI 1971 No,1835) on 1st January 1972, The Housing (Prescribed Forms) Regulations 1972 on 1st May 1972, Housing Finance Act 1972 on 27th July 1972, The Milk (Special Designations)(Amendment) Regulations 1972 on 1st October 1972, The Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations 1972 on 8th November 1972, The Gas Safety Regulations 1972 on 1st December 1972, 53 HOUSING Housing Aot, 1957 Clearance Areas,- Seventeen houses were represented under Section 157 of the Housing Act, 1957: 88 houses were demolished following declaration of Clearance Areas under Section 42 and a further 45 following compulsory acquisition under Section 43(2), Closing Orders,- Under Section 157 of the Act, five individual houses, five parts of houses and six basements were represented for closure; four Closing Orders were made under Section 17(1) and nine Closing Orders under Section 18, Under Section 27, Closing Orders were determined in respect of two houses, one part of a house and nine basements and permission was given for one house subject to a Closing Order to be used for storage purposes, Housing Acts, 1961-1969 Houses in multiple occupation 19,468 visits were made in this connection during the year, a total of 5,264 houses being visited for the first time of which 1,781 were found to be in multiple occupation, bringing the total of such houses on record to 8,985, An analysis shows the occupation of these houses to be as follows:- Occupancies: 2 3 45 6 78910 No, of houses: 5,298 1,918 745 402 278 163 78 53 50 The general practice is to try to get properties in multiple occupation brought up to a standard acceptable to the Corporation by informal action, and although a considerable amount of work is carried out by owners voluntarily, others have not been co-operative, and consequently it has been necessary to serve 185 notices under Section 16 of the Housing Act 1961, requiring the provision of means of escape in case of fire, and 63 notices under Section 15 of the Act requiring the provision of additional facilities within the premises, In three instances the owners failed to comply with these notices and the work was carried out in default, 54 The work carried out by owners, both voluntarily and following the service of notices, resulted in 361 houses being brought up to standard, In 596 instances, owners who had received either formal or informal notification that work was required reduced the number of lettings in their premises and in these circumstances no further action was taken, In some cases houses are over-occupied and the most satisfactory method of dealing with them is by making an Order under Section 19 of the Housing Act 1961 which imposes a limit of persons and households, 65 such Orders were made during the year and a further 11 notices of intention to make Orders were served, One existing order was varied to a higher number following improvements to the property and one order was determined, leaving a total of 153 Orders in force, In 9 instances where squalor existed, Management Orders were made, bringing the total number in force to 29; these Orders require the person managing the premises to ensure the cleanliness, repair and maintenance of all the parts of the property in common use, Maintaining the vigorous action in tackling multiple occupation is having the desired effect of controlling the problem, Housing Act, 1969/Housing Finance Act, 1972 Qualification Certificates,- Minor changes in procedure and the removal of anomalies were brought about by the Housing Finance Act, and the phasing out of controlled rents will have the effect of gradually making this qualification procedure obsolete, The following is a summary of applications received and action taken during the year:- 55 TABLE 1 1 Section 29(1)\xe2\x80\x94Where a dwelling does not have all the standard amenities Applications received 149 Applications withdrawn 19 Certificates of Provisional Approval issued 91 Qualification Certificates issued 98 Applications under consideration 163 Section 28(1)\xe2\x80\x94Where a dwelling already satisfies the conditions Applications received ,,, 211 Applications withdrawn 36 Notices of Refusal to issue Qualification Certificates 69 Qualification Certificates issued 254 Applications under consideration 662 Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 There are five licensed caravan sites containing a total of 21 dwellings in the Borough, Rent Act, 1968 This Act provides, amongst other things, for the issue by the Council of certificates of disrepair to tenants of controlled dwelling houses which are considered to be in disrepair by reason of defects which ought reasonably to be remedied, having regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling, There is also provision for the issue, by landlords, of undertakings to remedy such defects, Under the provisions of the Housing Fi nance Act 1972 this procedure is being phased out over a number of years, The following is a summary of action taken in this connection during the year:- TABLE 12 Applications for certificates of disrepair received 6 Certificates of disrepair issued 4 Undertakings received from landlords 1 Applications for cancellation of certificates of disrepair received Nil 56 Housing accommodation applications Applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on health grounds, These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants, Any case involving some special feature concerning the Health Department (e,g, fitness of basement rooms) is also referred to me, During the year, 1,673 applications were considered for eligibility for additional points on health grounds in accordance with the Council\'s points scheme, A further 2,078 recommendations were made in respect of Council tenants who requested transfer to more suitable alternative accommodation on health grounds, In my last Report I referred to the new procedure whereby applicants for rehousing could state on their application forms any medical reasons which might warrant priority in rehousing and could give authority for an approach to the family doctor for detailed information, The new system has now been in operation for over sixteen months and has proved successful in reducing the number of requests to general practitioners for medical certificates in support of rehousing, FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES In order to ensure that food businesses are supervised systematically, an up-to-date register is maintained of all premises where such business is carried on, Supervision is governed mainly by powers under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and regulations made thereunder but there are numerous other Acts of Parliament which relate to specific types of food, The supervision of catering establishments and premises where food is sold, stored, manufactured or prepared for sale is carried out by the public health inspectors in the Food Division, Samples of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst are obtained by the public health inspectors of this division and a detailed account of this work appears later in this section of the report, The total number of food premises of all kinds on the register in the Borough is 2,281 and during 1972 they were visited on 7,694 occasions, Details of the various types of food premises will be found in Table 13 which follows, 57 Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1970 These Regulations consolidate and amend the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960 and 1962, the principal changes in requirements being:- (i) raw food which has to be milled or refined to make it fit for human consumption is no longer outside the scope of the regulations (definition of "food", Regulation 2(1)); (ii) before food is offered for sale it must be separated from any food which is unfit for human consumption (Regulation 9 fbj); (iii) animal feed must not be kept in a food room unless it is in a closed container that eliminates the risk of contamination (Regulation 9(e)): (iv) any person handling open food (food not adequately protected by wrappings, etc,) must wear clean and washable overclothing, except in specified cases (Regulation 11); (v) the business of packing or storing eggs, fruit or vegetables on farm premises is made subject to certain requirements (Regulation 33), The separate categories of trade carried on in food premises which are subject to these Regulations are shown in Table 13 which also indicates the number of premises which comply with Regulation 18 relating to the provision of washing facilities for food handlers and Regulation 21 which requires the provision of facilities for washing food and equipment, Table 14 summarises the visits paid to food premises during the year and Table 15 shows the work carried out to comply with statutory requirements, i Legal proceedings,\xe2\x80\x94 Four summonses were issued under the above Regulations as follows:- (a) against two partners of a bakery in respect of the condition of the premises, The court imposed a total fine of \xc2\xa3300 for the ten offences and a sum of \xc2\xa350 for costs was awarded to the Council; (b) against a bakery proprietor in respect of the condition of the premises, The court imposed a total fine of \xc2\xa3200 for the eight offences and a sum of \xc2\xa320 for costs was awarded to the Council; 58 (c) against a bakery proprietor in respect of the condition of the premises', ' A

appointed as Acting Surveyor of Sewers, and Mr Coat as Acting Surveyor of Roads during six months, at a salary of \xc2\xa33 each per week The Committee held numerous sittings, and was still deliberating on the above references at the close of this Report Sevenoah Depot\xe2\x80\x94The new cottages at this Depot were completed during the year, and a tablet inserted in the wall bearing the names of the Chairman of the Vestry and members of the Inspection SubCommittee, with the date of erection Six cottages were built at a cost of \xc2\xa31,274, and were readily let at a rental of 6s per week each, the Vestry paying rates and taxes Some trouble was caused in the autumn of 1895 by a noxious effluvium arising from the water in the pond which received the refuse, the Vestry having covenanted to fill it up in a given time; and complaints were made by surrounding inhabitants The water was analysed and the pond examined by Dr Muter, analyst to the Vestry, who explained that the smell was caused by the fermentation of decayed vegetable matter set up by the autumn rains after a long hot summer; and upon his advice and with the concurrence of the Sevenoaks Rural and Urban District Councils the water was deodorised by treatment with sulphate of iron and slaked lime, no further deposits 1\'2 of refuse being made in the meantime The purchase of these materials, together with a quantity of permanganate of potash, cost the sum of \xc2\xa338 Is Ad On the 27th November the Roads and Depot Committee reported that in its opinion the time had arrived for the Vestry to have the right to drain the pond water into the stream on the boundary of the estate originally offered to the Vestry, also to provide this Depot with a small furnace for destroying vegetable and other offensive matter, as at Longfield ; and recommended that the question of the expediency of acquiring additional land should be referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry, having regard to the inquiry into Depot matters then in progress The Vestry agreed to this, and on the 11th December adopted the two following recommendations submitted by the Committee of the whole Vestry :\xe2\x80\x94 That the remaining portion of the Sevenoaks Estate offered to the Vestry for sale in the year 1891, viz 20 acres, with a house let at \xc2\xa320 per annum, be purchased for \xc2\xa32,300 That the Sevenoaks Depot, with the adjoining 20 acres of land agreed to be purchased, be mortgaged to secure the repayment of \xc2\xa32,500 by annual instalments of \xc2\xa3500, with interest at 4 per cent, per annum on the balance from time to time remaining unpaid, the first of such instalments to become due on the 25th December, 1896 In submitting the agreement for purchase to the Vestry for sealing on the 19th February 1896 the Clerk read the following explanatory report, when the agreement received the seal of the Vestry: \xe2\x80\x94 It will be remembered that in order to secure the land at Sevenoaks lying between our Depot premises and the stream the Vestry agreed to mortgage the whole of the estate for \xc2\xa32,500, by a repayment of \xc2\xa3500 per annum for 5 years, with 4 per cent interest on the balance for the time being remaining unpaid Some legal question having been raised as to the Vestry\'s power to mortgage, I have arranged for Mrs Murdock, the lady finding the money, to take up the conveyance from the Sevenoaks Estate Company for \xc2\xa32,300 and enter into an agreement with the Vestry to Bell the land to them at the same price, accepting payment in four instalments of \xc2\xa3500 each at Christmas in each year and the last instalment of \xc2\xa3300 at Christmas 1900, with interest at 4 per cent on the balance from time to time remaining unpaid By this arrangement the present Depot premises remain in the Vestry\'s possession unencumbered 73 The Vestry will upon completion of the agreement have all the rights of a freeholder over the land, merely indemnifying Mrs Murdoch against the covenants agreed to between the Vestry and the Sevenoaks Estate Company as to sidings and stream diversion Tf the Vestry should desire at any time to take up the conveyance they can by six months\' notice pay off the balance of the consideration money, with interest to the expiration of the notice I advise the Vestry therefore to seal the agreement I may say that the tenancy of the cottage and land at \xc2\xa320 per annum will expire at Michaelmas next, from which date I have secured another tenant at \xc2\xa340 per annum The posts attending this purchase amounted to \xc2\xa383 558 0d Provision was made in the estimates for 1896-7 for extending siding on the newly-acquired land and erecting a furnace Longfield Depot\xe2\x80\x94The boiler of the steam crane at this Depot, together with the steam pipes, was protected by a covering of fossil meal composition two inches thick in November 1895, the work being carried out by Messrs Haacke & Co for the sum of \xc2\xa36 108 On the 19th February 1896 the Vestry adopted the following report submitted by the Committee :\xe2\x80\x94 Your Committeee have considered the question of water supply, repairs and ventilations required to be canned out to the workmen\'s cottages under the viaduct at Longfield Depot, and they have arrived at the conclusion that it would be wiser to acquire the piece of land alongside the railway at this Depot whereon workmen\'s cottages can be erected rather than spend money in repairing the old cottages, with the prospect of their being condemned as unfit for dwellings in the near future by the Sanitary Authority for the district Your Committee have ascertained that the piece of land in question can be purchased for \xc2\xa3\'200, which they consider is very reasonable ; and under all the circumstances they have no hesitation in advising the Vestry to acquire the same, so that next year, when the estimates are under consideration, provision can be made for placing workmen\'s cottages thereon Your Committee therefore recommend : \xe2\x80\x94 That the triangular piece of freehold land, measuring la Ir 2p, alongside the railway at Longfield Depot as shown on plan submitted, be purchased for \xc2\xa3200 for the erection of workmen\'s cottages Three cottages or huts, standing on the ground and let for 10s per week, were included in this purchase, which was completed from the 25th March 1896, the costs amounting to \xc2\xa36 2s 6d 74 Longfield National Schools\xe2\x80\x94The Yestry granted its usual annual subscription of two guineas in aid of these schools on the 18th September 1895 Meopham Depot\xe2\x80\x94The concrete bays at this Depot were completed during the year, except the cement facing to the first four bays, and arrangements were in progress with the Railway Company for extending the siding next the manure docks so as to afford standing room for ten additional trucks, and thus avoid the inconvenience of having to pull out loaded trucks in order to remove empty ones A tablet was also erected similar to the one at Sevenoaks Inspection of Country Depots\xe2\x80\x94On the 12th June 1895 the Vestry resolved (on the motion of Mr Newman) to give those of its members who had not previously inspected the Country Depots an opportunity of doing so, on a Saturday afternoon The inspection accordingly took place on Saturday, 27th July, and was attended by 51 members of the Vestiy, representatives of the Press, and friends : the expenses amounting to \xc2\xa334 15s 0d Ploughing Matches\xe2\x80\x94On the 18th September 1895 the Yestry agreed to the same two resolutions as in the previous year (see last Annual Report, page 96), giving five guineas to the Stonehill and ten guineas to the North Kent Agricultural Association for distribution in prizes at their respective annual ploughing matches Cart Horse Parade on Whit Monday \xe2\x80\x94 A special meeting was convened on the 15th May to consider the following motion by Mr Westcott :\xe2\x80\x94 That the Vestry subscribe to the Cart Horse Parade Society, and also give every opportunity to the carmen in the employ of the Vestry to take part in the Cart Horse Parade to be held on Whit Monday next After a debate the motion was lost on a division by 43 votes to 14 Horses\xe2\x80\x94 Vestry\'s Stud\xe2\x80\x94There were 40 horses in the stud at the commencement of the year An old mare purchased in 1887 was slaughtered on the 11th March 1895, being worn out and having a chronic lameness in both fore feet ; and the stud at the close of the year therofore consisted of 39 horses The use of bearing reins was ordered to be discontinued in October 1895 75 Fodder consumed by the stud cost \xc2\xa31,302 17s 6d during the year under report, being an average of 12s 6\xc2\xbdd per horse per week For shoeing, new harness and repairs, oils, veterinary fees, wages of horsekeeper and assistant, repairs to stables, &c, the Vestry expended a sum amounting to \xc2\xa3531 15s 10d, or an average of 58 1d per horse per week The total cost for each horse was therefore 17s7\xc2\xbd d per week, as against 19s 1\xc2\xbdd for the previous year Return of

Trade had again extended the time for appearing before the Railway Commissioners, and that he was in negotiation with the Mansion House Association with the view of preparing a case to be brought before the Commissioners, failing an agreement with the Company A cheque for the Vestry\'s annual subscription of five guineas to the Mansion House Association on Railway and Canal Traffic was drawn

the Vestry authorised the Clerk to accept the Association\'s invitation to him to become a member of the permanent special committee appointed by it to deal with private sidings, rebates and analysis

working of the Depots be "referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry for inquiry and "report" The first step taken by this Committee led to the adoption of the standing order printed at page 14, ordering a card of membership to be given to each Vestryman entitling him to inspect any premises belonging to or work carried on by the Vestry A special Sub-Committee of 15 members\xe2\x80\x94five

sewer, thence through our local sewer grating into the roadway; accordingly although the smells evidently arose from the new outfall sewer yet they emanated from our surface ventilator, and the County

when the manure was removed, and I pointed out that this might be entirely done away with if the manure were loaded direct from the stables into covered carts, which should be removed when full, and suggested that the Vestry might be able to enforce this by availing themselves of the provisions of Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, which recites that " where any building or premises used for trade, business, process or manufacture causing effluvia, is certified to the Sanitary Authority by their Medical Officer of Health, or by any two legally qualified practitioners, or by any ten inhabitants of the district, to be a nuisance or dangerous or injurious to the health of any of the inhabitants of the district, such authority shall make a complaint, and if it appears to the Petty Sessional Court hearing the complaint that the trade, business, process or manufacture carried on by the person is a nuisance, then unless it is shown that such person has used the best practicable means for abating such nuisance, or preventing or counteracting the effluvia, the person so offending shall be liable to a fine not exceeding \xc2\xa350"; and as ihe Solicitor to the Yestry, to whom the question was referred, was of opinion that proceedings could be taken under this section, the Vestry resolved to do this in the future, should occasion arise', ' It would appear\xe2\x80\x94assuming this view of the law to be correct\xe2\x80\x94that the Vestry would also have power to stop the use of peat moss litter, as it is mainly when this is used \xe2\x80\x94as it
